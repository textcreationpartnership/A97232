            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Chriſt is made ours by Faith.</head>
                  <p>LEt us now in the next place, examine and ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be made ours in the ſight of God by faith? Mr. D. thus expreſſes himſelf, concerning this, <q>I muſt here profeſſe my ignorance, that I cannot conceive how Faith ſhould make Chriſt ours in the ſight of God.</q> It ſhould ſeem he doth not altogether deny that Chriſt is made ours by Faith, but will not yield that he is thus made ours in the ſight of God. Now, what his meaning in this may be, I do not certainly know, unleſs perhaps it be, that he is made ours by Faith, declaratively only, to our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, of which ſee <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. But when thoſe holy men, of whom he ſpeaketh, do ſay that Chriſt is made ours in the ſight of God by Faith, they do not exclude nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God the Author and principal efficient of this work, nor the word, the external inſtrumental cauſe thereof; but all our own works in oppoſition to faith. Their meaning therefore is, that Faith is the only internal inſtrument <hi>ex parte noſtra,</hi> on our part, or the only hand as it were of the Soul, whereby we do receive Chriſt; and he (according to his gracious promiſe unto all that do believe in him) is made ours.</p>
                  <p>Again, when they ſay that Chriſt is made ours in the ſight of God by Faith alone, they do oppoſe Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto mans. Men indeed, judging according to the judgment of charity, do hold him to be a good Chriſtian, and one that is intereſted in Chriſt, who outwardly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118801:7"/> maketh profeſſion of Chriſt, and in the ſight of man is unreproveable in his life and converſation. But as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf ſaid unto <hi>Samuel, The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.</note> 
                     <hi>for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord ſeeth the heart.</hi> In his ſight therefore who ſeeth things, and pronounceth of them as they are, Chriſt is made ours, not by an outward profeſſion, but by Faith alone. I am induced to be of this judgment with theſe holy men &amp; good Proteſtants, which Mr. D. here ſpeaketh of, by theſe Reaſons following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Chriſt is not ours, until we are made one with him, and he with us, no more then a woman can ſay, that her husband is hers, until they are made one by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</note> It is their union, or their being joyned together in marriage, which maketh the husband to be his wives, and the wife to be her husbands. And even in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is Chriſt made ours, when we are eſpouſed unto him by faith, and not before; whereupon it is that Chriſts Spouſe ſpeaketh with great rejoycing, and ſaith, <hi>My well-beloved is mine and I am his. Cant.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again, when it is ſaid, that Chriſt is ours, what is the meaning hereof, but that he is our Head, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Now he is the Head and Saviour of his Church, which is his Body, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly teacheth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. &amp; 5.23. Seeing therefore we are ingrafted into Chriſt and into his Church by Faith, and are ſaved by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. It followeth neceſſarily, that Chriſt is made ours by Faith. All unbelievers and ungodly men, are limbs &amp; members of the Devil, they cannot therefore be ſaid while they continue ſuch, to be members of the Lord Jeſus. For <hi>what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs, and what communion hath light with darkneſs, and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Now if men be thus eſtranged from Chriſt until they do believe, it muſt needs follow that by believing they do become Chriſts, and Chriſt theirs.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118801:7"/>
                  <p>Moreover the Scripture teacheth, that we do receive Chriſt by Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. Now what is this but to ſay, that he is made ours by Faith, and a man is not ſaid to receive that, which he hath allready, but which he wanteth, or which he is deſtitute of, until he do receive it. He that ſaith, he received a man into his houſe, or that he received this or that into his cuſtody, implyeth that neither the man was in his houſe, nor that thing in his cuſtody before. And he that ſaith, he received ſuch or ſuch a piece of gold, or ſilver of another, implyeth that he had it not before. So in like manner, ſeeing we are ſaid to receive Chriſt by Faith, what doth this import or imply? but that we were without Chriſt as long as we continued in unbelief, and conſequently that he became ours, when we believed in him? Laſtly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that at that time, to wit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.</note> when they were drowned in infidelity, they were without Chriſt, and without God in the world: But (ſaith he) <hi>Now in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, now that you do believe in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Ye, who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh,</hi> that is, unto God, by the blood of Chriſt. From hence alſo it is evident, that by believing in Chriſt it is that we come to be intereſted in God, and in his Son Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will here be ſaid; <label type="milestone">

                  <p>I grant that Chriſt after a ſort had right unto us and we unto him, before we believed in him, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118801:8"/> united unto him by his Spirit: For the Apoſtle telleth us plainly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.</note> that <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Now if thoſe who have not the Spirit of Chriſt (which is the caſe of unbelievers) be none of his, certainly then until they do by Faith receive Chriſt, they cannot be ſaid to be his, nor he theirs.</p>

                     </label> It's true indeed, if the gift be abſolute, and not ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon an uncertain condition, then the child had right <hi>ad rem</hi> (as the learned ſpeak) unto that thing which was thus given him, <hi>ſed non in re,</hi> but had no right in it, until being born, it became his at the time appointed by the Doner. And even in like manner, ſeeing Chriſt and his merits, are by himſelf and his Father in the Goſpel, as it were in a deed of gift, <hi>Seu in Charta Magna Regni Coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or in the Great Charter of the Kingdom of Heaven, conveyed and paſſed over, not unto all abſolutely, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believers only. I cannot ſee how we can be ſaid to have any right in or to Chriſt at all, or how he can be ſaid to be ours until we do believe, except only in his and his Fathers intention and Decree, which ſhall be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the due time appointed by him and his Father. Thus a Son that is taken into a Copyhold after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath a right unto that Copyhold; and therefore it may be ſaid to be his, but not ſimply and abſolutely, but only in reverſion. So all the elect of God before they do believe, have a right unto Chriſt, in that ſort, as I have before expreſſed; but they have no right nor inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him nor can he be ſaid to be theirs abſolutely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they do be ieve and receive him by Faith, no more than a Son, (<hi>Qui jus habet hereditatis ad Paterna bona,</hi> that is Heir unto his Fathers Lands and goods) can ſay while his Father liveth, that they are his own; for were they ſo, then <hi>Solomon</hi> could not ſay, that <hi>He that rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth his Father and Mother,</hi>

                  <p>Thus (as I ſuppoſe) I have made it manifeſt, that we have no right in Chriſt until we do believe in him, and that therefore he is made ours by Faith. It is true God gave Chriſt his only begotten Son, and Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto death for us, but it was with this purpoſe, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Decree, that we at the time appointed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by him and his Father, ſhould by Faith receive him, being offered unto us in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.

                  <p>A ſecond Objection of <hi>M. S.</hi> is this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>
                     </label> If Faith ſhould give us our intereſt in Chriſt, then as our Faith increaſeth, our intereſt ſhould increaſe, and we ſhould be more and more juſtified and forgiven, which none allow. It is true indeed, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                     </label> if Faith did juſtifie us by any inherent virtue or dignity of its own, then, as <hi>M.S.</hi> ſaith, the more we grow in Faith, the more we ſhould be intereſted in Chriſt, &amp; be more &amp; more juſtified: but he wel knoweth, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine is, that Faith juſtifieth not as it is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or any act of ours, <hi>ſed objectivè et correlativè,</hi> but in regard of Chriſt the object thereof, whereunto it relateth; Even as a Chirurgion may be ſaid to heal a man that is wounded, with his own hands; not that his hands, had any vertue in them to heal, but becauſe by them he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the wound, and applyed a healing plaiſter unto it, which drew out the purulent corruption, and cured him. For even ſo, are we in like manner ſaid to be juſtified and ſaved by Faith, becauſe we do by Faith lay hold of Chriſt, and apply his merits to our ſouls. So that, it is not ſo much Faith, as Chriſt in whom we believe; by whom we are juſtified and ſaved, that is, who hath both merited our juſtification, and doth actually acquit and abſolve us from our ſins. And in like manner doth Faith intereſt us in Chriſt, not for the dignity and worthineſs thereof; but becauſe it is Gods Ordinance and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ſhould receive Chriſt, and have him dwelling in our hearts by Faith. Whereſoever therefore there is true Faith to be found, though never ſo weak, and faint, or feeble, that man is a true member of Chriſt &amp; perfectly juſtified and abſolved from all his ſins. Thoſe of old amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that were ſtung with the fiery Serpents were perfectly cured, if they did look up to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118801:10"/> the braſen Serpent and beheld it, although their ſight was never ſo dark and dim, as well as the younger ſort, whoſe ſight was moſt perfect: ſo a weak Faith, as well as a ſtrong, doth lay hold of Chriſt, and of juſtification and ſalvation by him; For as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were healed by beholding the brazen Serpent, becauſe it was Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that health, which was otherwiſe wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, only by his own Divine power, ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follow and enſue: ſo the ſame is to be ſaid of Faith. And therefore from hence an anſwer may be given to that queſtion, which <hi>Mr. S.</hi> asketh in his next words, where ſpeaking of ſome, who call theſe other acts of Faith, that is when it is grown and encreaſed, Faith of aſſurance, and Acts of manifeſtation, he faith, If Faith be thus in its other degrees of working, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>
                     </label> Why not in its firſt? His meaning is (as I take it) if Faith when it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, doth only aſſure a man of his ſalvation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the pardon of his ſins manifeſt unto him, why doth not the firſt, and leaſt degree of Faith alſo, give us only an aſſurance, and manifeſtation of our ſalvation by Chriſt; but otherwiſe not any intereſt in him at all?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                     </label> Whereunto I anſwer: Firſt, that a ſtrong Faith doth give us that aſſurance, and evidence or manifeſtation of our ſalvation by Chriſt, which a weak Faith cannot; becauſe it doth lay firm hold on the promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (that are the only ground of aſſurance) which of a weak Faith are apprehended but weakly: even as an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> with a quick ſight, could by that natural vertue that was in his eye, more clearly behold the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent then he that had a dark and dim eye ſight. But as he that did lift up his eyes, and beheld the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, though never ſo weakly, was through Gods Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as perfectly cured, as he that ſaw and beheld it moſt clearly and moſt evidently: ſo Faith in the leaſt degree, through Gods Ordinance, is as effectual to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt us in Chriſt, and to make us partakers of ſalvation by him, as the ſtrongeſt Faith that is. Thus I have ſhewed the cauſe, or the reaſon why a weak Faith, can give us an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118801:10"/> intereſt in Chriſt, and the ſalvation which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us; although it cannot ſo firmly aſſure us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But whereas he holdeth, That Faith when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and grown ſtronger by an addition of more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees than it had at the firſt, doth only give us a greater manifeſtation, and aſſurance of ſalvation by Chriſt, but no intereſt in him; I cannot aſſent unto him in this, for the intereſt which we have in Chriſt and his merits, at the firſt by believing in him, is continued by perſeverance in the ſame Faith: and therefore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17.</note> as we are ſaid to receive Chriſt by Faith, ſo he is ſaid to dwell, that is to remain and make his abode in our hearts by Faith. Conſonantly whereunto the Apoſtle telleth us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14.</note> that <hi>We are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end.</hi> And on the contrary he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Thus Faith not only in the firſt act, or beginning of it, but in the continuance alſo, and greateſt height, or ſtrength thereof, doth intereſt us in Chriſt, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us partakers of him,</hi> as well as it doth evidence unto us and aſſure us hereof. Here therefore I would know whether it be not a manifeſt contradiction, to ſay as Mr. S. doth, Chriſt is ours without Faith, but we cannot partake of him as ours, but by believing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he objecteth alſo, and ſaith, If Chriſt ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be ours by Faith in this ſenſe, that is, actually: then, when Faith ceaſeth, ſhall we ceaſe to be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I anſwer, That no ſuch thing followeth hereupon: but the contrary; For upon our Faith and Repentance, our ſins are pardoned, and forgiven us, not for a time, but for ever,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.22.</note> 
                     <hi>They ſhall never therefore be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned unto us,</hi> that is, imputed and laid to our charge any more, no not when Faith ceaſeth. Neither needeth this to ſeem ſtrange to Mr. S. or any other, that Faith which is but temporal ſhould obtain an eternal pardon; for a ſalve which by its own inherent vertue, doth in a few days heal a wound, needeth afterwards to be uſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118801:11"/> no more; much leſs will there be any need of Faith in Chriſt, or of repentance, for the continuance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſins, and of our juſtification in the world to come, ſeeing by Chriſts Promiſe, and by his Ordinance, (which hath more force in it, then the moſt Soveraign or precious balm, or ſalve) upon our repentance and Faith in Chriſt, we are for ever acquitted and abſolved from all our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then Mr. S. in his next words demandeth, and asketh, Shall Faith begin our intereſt here, and not be able to continue it hereafter?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Mr S. proceedeth and asketh, Can a ſinner be too ſoul for a Saviour, and too wounded for a Phyſitian to heal, and too filthy for a fountain opened to waſh? To all which ſeveral demands of his, I will anſwer ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whereas he asketh, whether a ſinner can be too foul for a Saviour?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, No, if he will carefully and conſcionably pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and obſerve the means of ſalvation, which he doth preſcribe him, which are Repentance, Faith, and new Obedience. For as the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Chriſt being</hi> (in his paſſion) <hi>made perfect, he became the Author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation unto all them that obey him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</note> On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therefore whoſoever he is that doth not obey Chriſt, but doth wilfully contemn, or careleſly neglect the means of his ſalvation, (as many do) it is in vain for him to look for ſalvation by Chriſt, for as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith elegantly,<note place="margin">De verbis Apoſtoli Ser. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Qui fecit te ſine te, non te juſtificat ſine te,</hi> He that made thee without thee, doth not juſtifie thee without thee. His next demand is, Can a ſinner be too much wounded for a Phyſician to heal?</p>
                  <p>Surely no. Not for Chriſt our heavenly Phyſician: but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118801:11"/> then he muſt take his Phyſick, and obſerve ſuch a Dyet, as he preſcribeth him, that is, he muſt receive Chriſt and his merits by Faith, and live orderly according to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that is, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth it down. <hi>He muſt deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and live ſoberly,</hi>

                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godlily in this preſent world.</hi> On the contrary therefore, as long as infidelity, or incredulity poſſeſſeth his heart, and lyeth putrifying and rotting in his carnal luſts, it is in vain for him to think, or to perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he is healed by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas he asketh, Can a ſinner be too filthy, for a fountain opened to waſh?</p>
                  <p>Surely no, not for that fountain of which <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>That is opened to the houſe of</hi> David,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zac.</hi> 31, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for ſin and for uncleaneſs.</hi> But did he ever hear that a fountain, though never ſo limpid and clear,, did cleanſe any, unleſſe they did waſh themſelves with the water of it? And even in like manner ſhall none be purifyed, and cleanſed from their ſpiritual filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uncleanneſs, until they do by Faith-ſprinkle their ſouls with the bloud of Chriſt: For as we have heard St. <hi>Peter</hi> tell us, <hi>Chriſt purifieth the hearts of ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs by Faith.</hi> As long therefore as Faith with the inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects thereof are wanting, it is in vain for any to imagine that he is purified from his ſins.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He that offereth Chriſt (ſaith M. S.) offers all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the conditions in him both of Faith and Repentance, for <hi>Chriſt is exalted to give repentance unto Iſrael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Here firſt of all, it is to be obſerved, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Faith &amp; Repentance to be conditions required of us in the Goſpel; that we may be ſaved by Chriſt, which elſewhere he denyeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſaith, That God in offering Chriſt, doth offer theſe conditions in him. Which words of his, may receive a double conſtruction, or underſtanding. Firſt, that Repentance and Faith are not in our power; but that Chriſt hath merited theſe graces for us, and that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118801:12"/> doth work them in us by his ſpirit, when the Goſpel is preached. This the places of Scripture alleadged by him do prove, and we do conſtantly profeſſe and preach the ſame; but by that which he hath written in other places of this Treatiſe, I know that he hath another meaning, and that is, that Chriſt performed the conditions of the Covenant of grace, or of the Goſpel for us, that is, as he ſpeaketh, that he repented for us, and believed for us, and that his Faith and Repentance are in the Goſpel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, and are accepted of God for us, as if we our ſelves did repent and believe. This ſtrange opinion of his, I have examined, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 13. Whither I do referr you, for more ample ſatisfaction in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, It's no more (ſaith Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) to offer Jeſus Chriſt, then any grace of Chriſts, or gift of Chriſt, unto a ſinner. For a ſinner is as unprepared, and unfit for the one as the other, equally in ſin and pollution to both. All this is true, I grant, if he do ſpeak of a ſinner, as he is by nature and of himſelf. But what can be inferred, or concluded hence againſt the Proteſtant Doctrine, that hath been hitherto conſtantly taught, I cannot ſee nor perceive: but may rather wreſt his weapons out of his hands, and uſe them againſt himſelf. For if it be all one, or, as he ſaith, if it be no more to offer Chriſt then any grace of Chriſt, or gift of Chriſt, unto a ſinner, then ſeeing the grace, and gift of remiſſion of ſins, or of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is received by Faith, as both St. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26.18. Chriſt himſelf alſo is to be received of us by Faith: and as our ſins are not forgiven,, but we are bound over unto puniſhment for them in Gods word, until we believe in Chriſt; ſo neither can any have any intereſt in Chriſt, as long as we remain in infidelity and incredulity, &amp; do not believe in him contrary to Mr. S. &amp; Mr. <hi>D.</hi> new doctrine. Thus I have anſwered this Objection alſo, according to the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the words, wherein it was propounded. But thinking more intentively with my ſelf what M. S. his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118801:12"/> meaning might be, I gueſſed that his words muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Restricte,</hi> in a more reſtrained ſenſe, as if he ſhould reaſon thus, The graces of Faith and Repentance are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely offered in the Goſpel, without requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any antecedent act of Faith or Repentance, whereby they are to be received and made ours; therefore Chriſt is alſo as abſolutely offered without any condition, either of Faith or Repentance. Now hereunto I do anſwer, that all are in the Goſpel commanded to believe in Chriſt, and to repent that they may be ſaved by him, but Faith and Repentance were never offered to all, neither by Chriſt himſelf, nor by his Apoſtles when they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel, nor are the Miniſters of the Goſpel now ſo to offer them. It's true, Chriſt giveth Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This we are to teach,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31.</note> that men may be ſtirred up to ſeek both Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of Chriſt, in the uſe of ſuch means as he hath preſcribed. But it is one thing to teach this, and another to offer Faith and Repentance to all abſolutely. It is Chriſt and his merits, that are offered unto us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: but Faith is required of us, as the means whereby both himſelf and his merits are received, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and new Obedience is in joyned as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without which we can have no communion with Chriſt, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew hereafter. But if I ſhall grant that Faith and Repentance are offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in the Goſpel, yet I may retort the Argument of Mr. S. upon himſelf; for Faith and conſequently Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are not offered unto us, nor wrought in us, <hi>niſi mediante verbo,</hi> but by the means and miniſtery of the word, <hi>For Faith cometh by hearing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> 
                     <hi>and hearing by the word of God;</hi> therefore Chriſt is neither abſolutely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor abſolutely made ours, <hi>ſed mediante eodem verbo, et fide,</hi> but by means of the ſame word, and Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we receive him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I do argue thus, eternal life is not to be had without Faith in Chriſt. This St. <hi>John</hi> giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand when he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 20.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe things are written that ye
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118801:13"/> might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name.</hi> Seeing therefore (as Mr. S. ſaith) we are alike indiſpoſed to any gift of Chriſt, as we are to Chriſt himſelf, it followeth therefore neceſſarily, that ſeeing the gift of life is not ours without Faith, neither is Chriſt himſelf ours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, which if it be granted, it cannot be avoided, but muſt needs be acknowledged, that he is made ours by Faith. And this the Apoſtle expreſly avoucheth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Ye were at that time without Chriſt,</hi> that is, whileſt they were Infidels and unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>

                     </label> that Chriſt by bringing-in (as he ſpeaketh) that is, by working Faith and Repentance in the Soul, doth bring-in himſelf into it, and taketh, and keepeth poſſeſſion of it, and ſo we are intereſted in Chriſt. For until Chriſt worketh theſe graces in us by his Spirit, we are altogether aliens from him, and have no communion with him at all. It is no good reaſoning to ſay, Chriſt worketh Faith in us therefore we do not receive him by Faith, or he is not made ours by Faith: for he therefore worketh Faith in us, that by the ſame Faith we may lay hold on him and on his merits. <hi>Poſita primâ cauſâ, non tolluntur ſecundae.</hi> The working of the firſt cauſe doth not exclude the ſecondary, and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from acting that which appertaineth and belongeth unto them.

                  <p>To this I anſwer, That to receive Chriſts blood, is not, for a wicked ſinner, to believe (while he continueth in drunkenneſſe, and whoredome, or in any other vile ſins) that he is reconciled to God by the blood of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and he, do underſtand it; but it is to rely on Chriſts blood, both for the pardon, and purging away of his ſins, according to the promiſes of the Goſpel; which whoſoever doth, though he were never ſo unclean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his ſoul being thus ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, by a true and lively Faith, will become pure and holy: for neither ſhall his former ſins be imputed unto him, nor will he welter, and wallow in the puddle of ſin any more, but will ſerve God in righteouſneſs, and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all his dayes.</p>

                     <hi>Ye are all the children of God by Faith in Christ Jeſus, for as many as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> to wit, by that Faith of theirs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in their Baptiſm they made profeſſion. The meaning of this metaphorical ſpeech of his, is to teach us, that if we do appear before God naked, as we are of our ſelves, our filthineſs and deformity is ſuch, that God will loath and abhor us. We muſt therefore put on Chriſt, or cloath our ſelves with Chriſt, as it were with a garment, that we may be amiable in Gods eyes, that is, we muſt be united unto Chriſt, as a mans garment which he putteth on, is to his Body, before we can find any acceptance with God,: <hi>For he hath made us accepted in his beloved,</hi>

                     </note> That this is our receiving of Chriſt, our putting on of Chriſt, our living by Faith, that Faith aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us of Gods favour, and good will towards as in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.

                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </label> But I anſwer, That although Chriſt in Gods eternal counſel, was given us before the foundation of the world was laid, that is, decreed to be given us and to be made ours; yet he is not actually ours, until we receive him. For Chriſt is offered unto us in the Goſpel, as the gift of God, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. But as we all know, a gift when it is offered, muſt be received before we can have any intereſt or propriety in it. And hereupon it is, that Chriſt when he came amongſt his own Countreymen the Jews, and offered himſelf unto them, St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him, he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to thoſe that believed in his name;</hi> giving us to underſtand who they were that received him, to wit, ſuch as believed in him. Now why doth the Evangeliſt ſpeak thus, if Chriſt be not received by Faith? The Apoſtle telleth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118801:15"/> were without Chriſt.</hi> I would know therefore how they came to have Chriſt, but by receiving him, when he was offered unto them in the preaching of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>But here it may be ſaid, Chriſt in his Goſpel, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>To this I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                     </label> That Faith is required of us as the only inſtrument, or means, whereby we are to receive Chriſt, and his merits, when they are offered unto us in the Goſpel. For ſo ye have heard the Scripture tell us, that Chriſt is received by Faith, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.</note> that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and the inheritance of Heaven,</hi> which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, <hi>are received by Faith.</hi> Now there is no ſuch thing ſpoken, of Repentance, or new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but they are required in another reſpect, or for another Reaſon, to wit, That we may have communion with Chriſt, and glorifie the name of God, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by living holily. Thus both Faith and Repentance are Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, or of the Goſpel; but, in divers reſpects. For by Faith we receive Chriſt, and ſalvation by him; and without Repentance, we cannot receive him, or the ſalvation which by his death he hath purchaſed, and in his Goſpel offereth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. Briefly then, thus it is. Faith is a condition neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be performed by us, that we may thereby receive Chriſt, and be incorporated, and united unto him: Repentance is <hi>Conditio ſine qua non,</hi> that is, a neceſſary condition without the performance whereof,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</note> we can have no communion with Chriſt, nor hope of Heaven.</p>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:118801:16"/> to the receiving of Chriſt, or of juſtification, or of any other grace. For I would know of them, whether eternal life be not <gap reason="foreign">

Now what will they ſay, that nothing is to be done of us, that we are neither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor believe, nor to do any good works before we come to Heaven, that we may be ſaved by grace? If ſo, then let them profeſs themſelves Libertines, or if they will not do that, let them take heed, that they do not lay down ſuch Principles, whence Libertiniſme may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be inferred. For I would know of them, where, in all the Scripture, remiſſion of ſins is ſo granted by God that nothing is required of us neither Faith nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Where there is ſuch an abſolute grant, a man is tied to nothing; whence it will follow, that he may have remiſſion of ſins, and conſequently be ſaved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he never believe, repent, nor amend his life, but live in ſin all his dayes.</p>

For God doth not force his graces upon us, nor doth not work upon us, as on ſtocks or ſtones: but ſeeing he hath made us reaſonable creatures, he therefore ſpeaketh unto us by his word, and perſwadeth, and inableth us by his Spirit, to do thoſe things, which he requirerh of us. Thus he dealeth with us, as with men; but yet ſo, that ſtill our ſalvation is wholly of his grace, both the beginning, middle, and the end thereof. For though it bee, we that do repent, and believe, and obey; and not God: yet we do all this, not of our ſelves, but by his grace.

                  <p>THe former whereof is, That if the Love of God be taken properly, as it is in it ſelf <hi>pro actu divini amoris,</hi> for the internal Act of Gods Love, ſo it is immutable, eternal, and ever the ſame, <hi>accidens enim in Deo nullum eſt,</hi> and hereupon it is that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>God is Love;</hi> his Love therefore muſt needs be immutable, and eternal, as he himſelf is. Wherefore if we ſhall ſpeak of Gods Love properly, ſo it muſt be granted, that he loved his people from all eternity, even before they did believe in Chriſt, and forſake their ſins.

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:118801:20"/>
                  <p>The firſt whereof is, That God hates the works, but not the perſons of his elect.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, That God loveth his elect before their converſion, <hi>amore benevolentiae, ſed non complacentiae,</hi> with a love of benevolence, not of complacencie.</p>
                  <p>The third, that God loveth them with the love of election, but not of juſtification: all which he ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rejecteth. And then taketh upon him to unty the knot thus. The Lord hateth all the workers of iniquity, is the voice of the Law; The other, the Lord loves ſinners<note n="*" place="margin">He ſhould ſay, workers of iniquity.</note>, is the voice of the Goſpel. Now the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſpeak divers things; the one being the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods juſtice, tells us what we are by nature: the other being the manifeſtation of Gods mercy, tells us what we are by grace in Jeſus Chriſt. Thus he: Now I do acknowledge indeed, that the Law doth reveal Gods wrath againſt ſin, and paſſeth ſentence of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only on thoſe that are workers of iniquity; but on every one that commiteth the leaſt ſin that is: for ſo it ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8.</note> Again it is not the Law, but the Goſpel alſo that ſaith, <hi>Except ye Repent,</hi>

                     <hi>The Lord hateth all workers of iniquity.</hi> Firſt it may be ſaid, that if we ſhall ſpeak of the elect themſelves, not as they are elect, but being conſidered as they before their calling and converſion were workers of iniquity, as well as others, ſo God hated them, though not <hi>odio, redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante in perſonas illorum,</hi> or <hi>odio inimicitiae,</hi> that is, ſo as to reprobate, or to reject and caſt them off, yet <hi>odio abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t onis,</hi> that is, ſo that he was offended and diſpleaſed with them while they took ſuch courſes, and did not love them (<hi>amore complacentiae,</hi> with a love of complacencie) but loath them while they were polluted, and defiled with their ſins. Thus afterwards in the very next verſe, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Virum ſanguinum et doli abhominabitur Jehovah.</hi> The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. I find that <hi>Eſtius in tert. Sent. et in D ſt.</hi> 32. and others, do ſay, That God doth hate the elect, <hi>quoad statum preſentem ſuum,</hi> while they live in ſin, and are unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; alleadging for confirmation hereof, this very ſaying of <hi>David, The Lord hateth all the workers of iniquity,</hi> and that in the 14th Chapter of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, Similiter odio ſunt Deo, impius et impietas ejus,</hi> The ungodly and his ungodlineſs are both alike hateful unto God. Thus do they ſpeak of the elect being conſidered, as they were ſinners before their converſion. But otherwiſe if we ſhall conſider the elect, as God in his eternal Counſel and Decree ſaw them juſtified and ſanctified, ſo he loved them, not only <hi>amore benevolentiae,</hi> that is, with ſuch a love whereby he did will their good, <hi>ſed complacentiae,</hi> but of complacencie, or delight. For thus all things are preſent with God, <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> from all eternity, and there is nothing neither paſt, nor future unto him. And the the reaſon hereof is,<note place="margin">God knew all things moſt perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of them were.</note> becauſe he ſeeth all things that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, were or ever ſhall be in the world, <hi>non extra ſe in creaturis</hi> not without himſelf, in the creatures, as we do; but <hi>in ſe,</hi> in himſelf, that is, in his eternal Counſel and Decree, or, <hi>in ſe, non ſolum tanquam in cauſa efficiente, ſed exemplari rerum omnium.</hi> Wherefore although being conſidered, as we were in our ſelves before our calling
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118801:21"/> and converſion, that is, full of ſin, and void of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we may in ſome ſenſe, be ſaid to be objects of Gods hatred; yet, as we were veſſels of Election, ſo we were alwaies beloved. For as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tract.</hi> in <hi>Johan.</hi> 112. <hi>Deus omnes ſanctos ſuos ante mundi conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem dilexit, ſicut praedeſtinav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t,</hi> God loved all his Saints before the foundation of the world, as they were of him predeſtinated. For we muſt not ſay, that God abſolutely and ſimply, firſt hateth, and then loveth the ſame things, as men do; for then we ſhall make him variable &amp; muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as we our ſelves are, whereas there is neither <hi>Variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor turning,</hi>

                  <p>This anſwer I do prefer before the former.

For ſaith he, <hi>odiſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur Deus, quibus male vult,</hi> God is ſaid, to hate thoſe whom he beareth ill will unto.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118801:22"/> would know of Mr. D. why he doth ſay, that Faith doth juſtifie declaratively, if the Goſpel which preacheth Faith in Chriſt, doth declare the love of God, either to all, or to any, that are workers of iniquity? For Faith cannot be without a reformed converſation, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledgeth? All the workers of iniquity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are deſtiture of true juſtifying Faith,<note place="margin">Reconcil. of God to man. pag. <hi>44.</hi>
                     </note> whereby to be aſſured of Gods love &amp; of their ſalvation by Chriſt. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> therefore, will he nill he, muſt needs acknowledge, that if Faith do juſtifie declaratively, then the Goſpel doth no where declare the Love of God towards the workers of iniquity, and conſequently, That it is not only the voice of the Law, but of the Goſpel alſo, that ſaith, <hi>The Lord hateth all the workers of iniquity.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſecond Concluſion is this, If we ſhall ſpeak of the Love of God, as it doth manifeſt it ſelf by its effects, ſo it is neither eternal, nor alwaies the ſame, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greater, and ſometimes leſſer towards his children. And in this ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of Gods Love,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſa.</hi> 147.8.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous:</hi> and <hi>Solomon Prov.</hi> 8.17. where he bringeth in the Son of God, the eternal wiſdom of his Father, ſpeaking and ſaying, <hi>I love them that love me,</hi> that is, them only and none elſe. Now there was a time when the elect did not love God, but the world and the things thereof, a time when they were not righteous, but wicked; they were not at that time therefore loved of God in this ſenſe, as <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> here ſpeak of his Love, that is, ſo as to taſte, or to be made partakers of the comfortable effects thereof. The Lord alſo ſpeaketh of his Love <hi>tanquam de re futura,</hi> as of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118801:22"/> a thing to be accompliſhed in time to come, when he ſaith or his revolted people, <hi>I will love them freely. I will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> he did not therefore thus love them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. Now this alſo muſt be underſtood, not of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Act of Gods love, which is eternal; but of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his love, in the ſaving effects thereof. Thus alſo are we to underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he bleſſeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and prayeth for them ſaying,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> 
                     <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God be with you.</hi> For his meaning is not, that God would then firſt begin to love them, as if he had hated them, or had borne them no good will before; but that he would multiply the effects of his Love upon them, or that he would continue the gracious influence of his Love towards them, in the moſt comfortable and ſaving effects thereof. In the ſame ſenſe alſo doth our Saviour ſpeak of Gods Love,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 14.21.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath my Commandements and keepeth them, it is he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi> When Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I will love him,</hi> he ſpeaketh (as the next words do ſhew) of the manifeſtation of his, and his Fathers love, by the ſaving effects thereof, <hi>Tunc enim Deus novâ ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſuam exhibet dilectionem, cum novo homines afficit bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio.</hi> For then doth God exhibit his Love after a new manner, when he beſtowetn on men a new benefit, ſaith <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Like whereunto are the words of <hi>Dioniſius Carthuſianus</hi> on this ſaying of Chriſt. God loveth all that are predeſtinate eternally, and ſimply even then, when they do not love him, but are wicked. For he firſt loved us.<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19.</note> He loveth them (I ſay) according to that he ſeeth them to be, in his Decree of Predeſtination. But when they are converted and do love God, he beſtoweth on them the effects of his Love, which he doth fully, and finally vouthſafe them, when they obtain the inheritance of Heaven, <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> alſo <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Sent. Dist.</hi> 32. doth excellently unfold this matter, I will therefore ſhut up this diſcourſe in his words. The Love of God (ſaith he)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118801:23"/> is conſidered two manner of waies, <hi>ſecundum eſſentiam, et ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> efficientiam,</hi> according to the eſſence &amp; according to the efficiency of it. It is neither more nor leſs according to the eſſence; but according to the efficiency of it: In w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> regard thoſe may be ſaid to be more loved, for whom out of his love he hath from eternity prepared <hi>majus bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the greater good, or a greater bleſſing; and doth in time confer the ſame upon them: and thoſe leſſe lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, <hi>quibus non tantum,</hi> for whom and on whom, he hath from eternity prepared, and in time beſtoweth, not ſo much good, or not ſo great a bleſſing. Thereupon alſo it is, that ſome when they are converted, and juſtified, are ſaid then to begin to be loved of God; not that God can love any one <hi>nova dilectione</hi> with a new love: yea, he loved with everlaſting love before the foundation of the world, whomſoever he loveth. But they are then ſaid to begin to be loved of him, when they receive the effects of Gods eternal love, to wit, grace or glory. Whereupon <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, Far be it from us that we ſhould ſay, that God loveth any one temporally, as it were with a new love, which was not in him before, with whom, <hi>nec prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terita tranſierunt,</hi> neither the things that are paſt, have paſſed away, <hi>et futura jam facta ſunt,</hi> and thoſe that are future, are already preſent or are done. Therefore he loved all his Saints before the foundation of the world <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut praedeſtinavit,</hi> as they were predeſtinated by him. But when they are converted and do find him, then they are ſaid to begin to be loved of him, <hi>Ut eo modo dicatur, quo poteſt humano affectu capi, quod dicitur,</hi> to ſpeak after that manner, that the thing which is ſpoken, may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by mans capacity.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo when God is ſaid to be angry with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and well pleaſed with the good, the change is in them and not in Him, as light is offenſive to weak eyes, but comfortable to ſtrong; to wit, through the change that is in them, not in it ſelf: ſo when any one begins to be Gods friend being juſtified, he himſelf is changed, not God.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118801:23"/>
                  <p>Now if the Queſtion be asked, whether one may be ſaid to be loved of God more at one time then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>diſtinguenda est dilectionis intelligentia,</hi> that we may underſtand this aright, we muſt diſtinguiſh of love; for if it be referred unto the effects of love, <hi>conceſſibile eſt,</hi> it is to be granted, that God doth love ſome, more at one time than at another; but if it be referred to the eſſence of Gods Lo e, <hi>inficiabile eſt,</hi> it is to be denied? Hitherto <hi>Peter Lumbard.</hi> And thus this deep myſtery, or matter is ſufficiently cleared. I'le onely add two things more to pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent the miſtaking of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The former is, that all thoſe, <hi>quibus ab aeterno Deus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vult,</hi> whom God eternally loveth, ſhall in time, have all thoſe good things, that is, thoſe effects of grace, wrought in them which he decreed for them. As long therefore as men do live in ſin they cannot conclude, nor they cannot believe, that God loveth them with any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love, as he doth his Elect, whom he hath appointed heirs of ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe as yet no effects of Election do appear in them.</p>
                  <p>The other thing which I think good here to add is that Mr. D. hath no cauſe ſo ſharply and bitterly (as he doth) to repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e ſome of our Proteſtant Preachers and writers, becauſe they tell men, that if they forſake ſin, and follow after Gods commandements, and do that which is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his ſight, then God will love them. For ſeeing they ſpeak no otherwiſe of Gods Love than the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth, Why ſhould he ſo rack their words, as if they taught, that God were mutable in his Love, as man is, and not rather underſtand them to ſpeak popularly of the Love of God, as the Scripture it ſelf doth in thoſe places, which I have before alleadged, that is, not in regard of the eſſence, but of the efficiency and influence thereof, in its gracious and moſt comfortable effects. He hath the more reaſon thus candidly to inrerpret their words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are (at leaſt ſome of them) no ſuch babes, that they can be thought to be ignorant of the eternity and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118801:24"/> immutability of Gods Love, being conſidered ſimply as it is in it ſelf, any more then of his other Attributes.</p>

                     </note>MR. D. diſtinguiſheth hereof, and ſaith, That it is twofold. 1. Gods Reconciliation to us. 2. Our Reconciliation to God. Of which he ſpeaketh thus, We have not one jot, not one apex in all the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be found of reconciling God to us: but of our reconciliation to God. Why then doth he write ſo much of Gods reconciliation to us, not well weighing what he ſaith? For Reconciliation importeth precedent enmity, or at leaſt ſome diſtaſt, and diſpleaſure taken for ſome fault committed or offence given. For as <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Epiſtolam ad Coloſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Davenantius,</hi> and other learned do ſay, <hi>Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are nihil aliud eſt, quàm amicitiam offenſione aliqua diremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam reſarcire, et ſic inimicos in priſtinam concordiam reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> To reconcile, is nothing elſe, than to repair friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip after it hath been broken off by ſome offence, and ſo of enemies to make them agree again, as they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

                  <p>And this indeed Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ingenuouſly acknowledged;<note place="margin">Reconcil. of God to man. pag. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> for becauſe God alwaies loved his elect: therefore ſaith he, he cannot properly be ſaid to reconcile himſelf unto them. And may not I ſay further, Becauſe he never wronged them, nor gave them any juſt cauſe of offence; therefore in propriety of ſpeech, he cannot be ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himſelf unto them. But I have no intent to carp at words ſo that no wrong ſenſe be couched under them.

When a ſinner by Faith in Chriſt obtainerh pardon of his ſins, then he is reconciled to God.

                  <hi>Queſt. 5.</hi> Whether the Doctrine of Reconciliation, as Mr. D. hath propounded it, be a better means of comfort to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſsed conſciences, then our Proteſtant Doctrine is?</head>
               <p>FIrſt, He teacheth that God was reconciled to us, that is, as he underſtandeth it, that he loved us, <hi>ab aeterne,</hi> from all eternity, without any precedent diſpoſitions, or qualifications, which he found, or fore-ſaw in us, or any conditions to be performed by us, to gain His love and His favour. Now whatſoever comfort this can afford to any, if it be a means to keep thoſe that are great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or ſuch as are troubled with the apprehenſion of their own unworthineſſe from deſpair, our Doctrine will do the ſame alſo. For there is no judicious, nor no orthodox Proteſtant, who teacheth not, that God loved us freely from everlaſting, and that His love is the cauſe of our loving Him, and of all the goodneſs that is in us, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19.</note> and not that he loveth us, becauſe we love Him, to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of his Love, as it is in it ſelf: though otherwiſe when we ſpeak of Gods Love, according to the influence it hath upon us, or according to the gracious effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we ſay as the holy Scripture doth that <hi>the Lord will love thoſe that love him, and keep his commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſenſe our Saviour ſpeaketh of Gods Love, <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words,</hi>

                  <hi>and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 16.27. <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have loved me, &amp; have believed that I came out from God.</hi> Where we muſt not ſo underſtand our Saviour, as if he made his Diſciples loving of him, and believing him, to be the cauſe why God did firſt ſet his Love upon them, for he loved them erernally: but to be the cauſe, why God did aboundantly teſtifie his Love towards
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118801:28"/> them, by many gracious, rare, and moſt comfortable effects thereof, rather than to the world. We may ſay therefore as <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſianus</hi> doth, That our Saviour in theſe words, ſetteth down the cauſe of Gods Love, <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> that is, he cauſe of the effects of Gods Love, and ſo maketh his Diſciples loving of him, and believing in him, a ſign and an aſſurance unto them, that his Father loved them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo telleth us, That <hi>he counted all things he had but as dung that he might win Chriſt, &amp; be found in him, not having his own righteouſneſs which was of the Law,</hi>

                  <p>In theſe words, St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us to underſtand, that there was a time when he was not in Chriſt, for otherwiſe, why doth he ſay, that he accounted al things but dung that he might win Chriſt and be found in him, if he had been in him already.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thoſe words of the Apoſtle alſo do fully confirm this, <hi>VVe who are Jews by nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>and not ſinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Christ, even we have believed in Jeſus Christ that we might be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law: for by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> Hence I do reaſon thus, In the ſame ſenſe that the Apoſtle denieth juſtification to works, he attributeth it to Faith. This is evident, becauſe he maketh a manifeſt oppoſition between juſtification by the works of the Law, and by Faith in Chriſt. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth us to be juſtified by works before God, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively to others, or to our own conſciences. On the contrary therefore, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Faith of Christ,</hi> his meaning is, that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified actually and before God by Faith, and not declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively only to our own conſciences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Again, I do reaſon thus, Without Chriſt there is no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118801:29"/> remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.5. But men before they believe, are without Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11.12. Therefore before they believe, their ſins are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or, which is all one, before they believe, they are not juſtified, nor abſolved from their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Moreover St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> receive forgiveneſs of ſins by Faith in Chriſt, not before, but after our converſion. For ſo he ſaith, that <hi>God ſent him unto the Gentiles to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance amongſt all that are ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt.</hi> Hence I infer, that they were not juſtified and abſolved from their ſins, before they were enlightened and believed in Chriſt, even while they walked in darkneſſe, and were under the power of Satan. For what needs the Apoſtle to ſay, that he was ſent to turn them from darkneſs to light, that they might by Faith receive forgiveneſs of ſins, if they had had it before?</p>
                  <p>Like hereunto is that of St. <hi>Peter, Be it known unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> you men and brethren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3.</note> 
                     <hi>that by this man</hi> (by Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe</hi> (not any before they believe) <hi>are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> For the Law juſtifieth none, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all that do not in all things obſerve it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. From which condemnation (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> here teacheth) they are not abſolved and freed, but by Faith in Chriſt. Now what is this but to ſay, that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith and not before Faith, or without it?</p>
                  <p>I may alſo reaſon thus, Whoſoever is juſtified, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> unto God, and through Chriſt doth pleaſe him: For he is that beloved Son of the Father in whom he is well pleaſed with all that are in Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. But without Faith, it is not poſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Therefore neither is it poſſible that any one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith ſhould be juſtified.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118801:30"/>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Again, there is no remiſſion of ſins to be had without repentance; for our Saviour hath joyned remiſſion of ſins and repentance together. He telleth his Diſciples, That repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name amongſt all Nations, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. And <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaith, That God hath exalted Chriſt with his own right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour for to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. To whom alſo hath God promiſed remiſſion of ſins? Verily not to thoſe that do live in ſin, but that do leave their ſins, and return unto GOd, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22, 23, 24. Pardon of ſin therefore, or, which is all one, juſtification and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from ſin, is not to be had until a man do repent and become a new man.</p>
                  <p>But what need I to heap up any more teſtimonies, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> to uſe any more reaſons, ſeeing St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhutteth up his diſputation of juſtification in theſe words, <hi>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by Faith without the deeds of the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.28. It will not ſerve M. D.'s turn to ſay, That <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is, that we are juſtified declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to our own conſciences by Faith only, and not by works. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> who ſpake by the ſame Spirit that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, teacheth us, That by the conſtant practice not only of Faith, but of other vertues and good works alſo, we are to make our Calling and Election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. that is, to our own ſouls and conſciences. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently therefore, by the ſame works may alſo be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in our conſciences of our juſtification before God, and of our reconciliation to his Divine Majeſty. For he that is aſſured of his Election, and of his effectual Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is aſſured of his juſtification and ſalvation. Mr. D. therefore ſetteth a falſe gloſſe upon St <hi>Pauls</hi> words, when he ſaith, that his meaning is not that we are actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before God by Faith only; but declaratively to our own conſciences: for thus are we juſtified by other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as well as by Faith.</p>

                  <p>And even ſo in like manner when the Apoſtle ſaith, that God juſtifieth the ungodly, and that we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, when we were enemies; the meaning is not, That the ungodly remaining ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are juſtified, or that any are enemies to God after they are actually reconciled unto him: but that we who by nature and of our ſelves were ungodly, and therefore ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were juſtified from that ungodlineſs of ours, and reconciled unto God when we believed in Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118801:32"/> in time, as the outward works of God are. Whereupon he inferreth and concludeth, that when the Scripture ſaith, We are juſtified by Faith, the meaning hereof is, that we are juſtified by Faith in <hi>tribunali conſcientiae,</hi> that is, that God when we believe in Chriſt juſtifieth us in the tribunal which be ſetteth up in our own ſouls, and conſciences, but that otherwiſe we were juſtified <hi>ab aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no apud Deum,</hi> eternally with God. But methinks this expoſition of his quite overthroweth the Doctrine of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith, as it is taught by the Proteſtants. For the Proteſtants Doctrine is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that our juſtification is, <hi>actus individuus,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual act, that is, accompliſhed all at once, in one and the ſame inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>quòd non admittit majus et minus,</hi> that it is not increaſed nor diminiſhed by degrees, as our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is. But this juſtification is not any ſuch indiviſible act. For frequent and ordinary experience ſheweth, that thoſe who are. Believers and in the ſtate of grace, yea, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chriſtians otherwiſe, are ſomtimes confident that their ſins are pardoned, and that they are in Gods favour; and, at other times, though they rely ſtill upon God, for the pardon of their ſins, and for ſalvation by Chriſt, yet they cannot ſay, that they are pardoned.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the Children of God, have ſometimes a greater, ſometimes a leſſer aſſurance of the pardon of their ſins, and of their ſalvation, and ſometimes hardly any at all. The reaſon whereof in many of them, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy abounding, which depraveth the fancy, depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the heart, and alwaies raiſeth fears in oppoſition, contrary to that which a mans heart is ſet upon, and which it moſt deſireth. Somtimes again, the Faith of the Believer, is aſſailed with ſtrong, ſtrange, and hideous temptations, which deprive him of that aſſurance, which formerly, he had, or were it not for theſe temptations, would have. And ſometimes alſo weakneſs of judgment in thoſe whoſe hearts are upright with God, is a great cauſe, why they cannot lay hold of that comfort which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118801:33"/> belongeth unto them. Now if we ſhall ſay, that a man is juſtified by Faith, when his Faith doth declare and evidence unto his conſcience that his ſins are pardoned, then we ſhall exclude ſome of theſe good Chriſtians from the ſtate of juſtification, and of others of them we ſhall ſay, contrary to the common tenent of Proteſtants, that they are ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>

                     </label> I anſwer it thus, That the Decree indeed of juſtifying, or abſolving Believers, is an immanent and eternal Act of God. Thus they are juſtified <hi>ab aeterno in mente Dei,</hi> eternally in Gods counſel, or in Gods mind and purpoſe, even as thoſe that are arraigned in Courts of juſtice here in this world, are acquitted, or condemned <hi>in animo et mente judicis,</hi> in the Judges mind and decree or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, before he paſſeth ſentence of judgment upon them. But they are not actually judged, until this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced, and publiſhed. Now the ſame is to be ſaid concerning the actuall juſtification of thoſe that do believe in Chriſt. For juſtification, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do prove by the Scriptures, <hi>eſt vocabulum forenſe,</hi> is a judicial term, and therefore is to be taken, <hi>in ſenſu forenſi,</hi> in a judicial ſenſe. It importeth therefore an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal judicial act of God, that is to ſay, his pronouncing or publiſhing of ſentence of judgment. For then is a Judge ſaid to judge him that is arraigned before him, when he giveth either ſentence of abſolution, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon him: and even in like manner, God the judge of all the world doth juſtifie thoſe that believe in Chriſt, by paſſing ſentence of abſolution upon them, and condemneth all unbelievers, and ungod y ſinners, by giving ſentence of condemnation againſt them.</p>

                  <p>This anſwer offered it ſelf unto me long ſince, when I read the former Objection, and I have found ſince, that it was no new invention, or device of mine own, but the old Proteſtant Doctrine.<note place="margin">

For neither is the arraigned perſon ſaid to be abſolved, that is, juſtified, (though the Prince have decreed that he ſhall be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) until the arraigned perſon himſelf, hath heard the voice of abſolution, and hath aſſented thereunto. When we hear the voice of the Goſpel, we hear the voice of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; when we aſſent thereunto, we do <hi>reipſa,</hi> really or indeed receive abſolution, or are juſtified.

                  <p>This anſwer, I conceive is the ſame in ſenſe with the former. For I demand, What change of eſtate is there in him that is juſtified?

For although Chriſt do by his Spirit abſolve the Believer <hi>in foro conſcientiae ſuae</hi> in his own conſcience: yet hereby he is not juſtified before God, but in his conſcience aſſured of his juſtification, as hath been before declared. <hi>See Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>who (I think) hath excellently unfolded this matter in his</hi> Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes <hi>of juſtification.</hi>

                  <p>For, beſides all the former teſtimonies that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoning up the ſeveral links of the golden chain of our ſalvation, and ſetting them down in order, doth not rank our Juſtification with our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but placeth it after our Vocation: for ſo he ſaith, <hi>whom God hath predestinated, them he hath called; whom he hath called, them he hath justified; whom he hath juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, them he hath glorified.</hi> Now it is certain, we are called in time, <hi>non ab aeterno,</hi> not from everlaſting. It followeth neceſſarily therefore, that we were not eternally juſtified, but at that very time, when being effectually called, we did believe in Chriſt. For as the Apoſtle here informeth us, <hi>objectum juſtificationis adaequatum ſunt vocati,</hi> the called of God, (that is, effectually by his ſpirit ingrafting his word in their hearts) are the adequate object of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that is, all ſuch, and only ſuch called ones doth God juſtifie. 'Tis evident therefore from theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that none are actually juſtified until they are called.</p>
                  <p>The force of this Reaſon will not be avoided by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh here of a declarative juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or of juſtification, not as it is really acted, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Again, in this golden Chain of our ſalvation, predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the firſt Principle, or firſt cauſe of it, glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the end or conſummation of it, and the means by which we do proceed from predeſtination to glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are our vocation and juſtification. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of a real juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for the manifeſtation thereof unto a Believers conſcience, is no neceſſary means of his ſalvation. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard and harſh ſentence it would be to ſay, That none can poſſibly be ſaved, who is not aſſured of his ſalvation, by having it made evident to his conſcience, that his ſins are pardoned, and that he is in the ſtate of grace.

                  <p>LOng after I had finiſhed this Treatiſe, a Souldier that quartered with me, in a calm conference, that we had together, reaſoned thus againſt me, to prove that men are juſtified before they do believe, even from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>VVho ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth,</hi> that is, the Elect. But men are elected before they do believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are juſtified before they believe.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Major</hi> propoſition, to wit, That God juſtifieth the Elect,</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that all the Elect are actually juſtified, not as ſoon as they are elected, but in that time, and after that manner as God in his Decree of Election hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined &amp; ſet down, that is, when they do believe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> explaineth himſelf in the words following, where he firſt moveth another Queſtion like to the former, ſaying, <hi>VVho ſhall condemn?</hi> And then he anſwereth, <hi>It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who alſo ſitteth at the right hand of God, and maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> [us believers.] And then he asketh us again, <hi>VVho ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> us, he meaneth, who do believe in Chriſt, and are his members. Thus he uſeth theſe two words indifferently, Elect and Us, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſame perſons, and ſo giveth us to underſtand, that when he ſaith, <hi>VVho ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth,</hi> he ſpeaketh of the Elect as they are Believers, in the ſame ſenſe as he ſaid before, <hi>thoſe whom he did predeſtinate, them alſo he called, and whom he justified, them alſo he glorified;</hi> not that they were actually called, as ſoon as they were predeſtinated;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118801:36"/> or glorified, as ſoon as they were juſtified. But either, becauſe they were ſo <hi>apud Deum</hi> with God, to whom all things are preſent. Or elſe he ſaith not, whom he hath predeſtinated, them he will call; &amp; whom he hath juſtified, them he will glorifie: but he hath called, he hath glorified them, becauſe they ſhall in the due time, appointed by God, he as certainly called and glorified, as if they were ſo already. And even ſo in like manner, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is God that juſtifieth the Elect,</hi> he ſpeaketh thus, becauſe of the certainty of their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                     </label> according to the eſſence of our humane nature, wherein ſin is inherent, we were the creatures of God. It followeth not therefore as the learned and moſt worthy <hi>Chamier</hi> would have it, that God loved us meerly as ſinners, but as his creatures. As a father redeemeth and releaſeth his riotous ſon out of priſon, into which he is caſt for debt, <hi>non quatenus prodigum,</hi> not as he is an unthrift, but as he is his ſon, whom he loveth, though he hate his vice. This moſt learned man therefore, did not ſo well confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the Matter when he ſaid <hi>Monſtra ſibi fingunt,</hi> they feign monſtrous conceits to themſelves, who ſay that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who are juſt neither by their own, nor by anothers righteouſneſſe are loved of God, that is, meerly as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than which nothing can be deviſed more abhorrent to divinity. This is true indeed, if we ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled and inforced by our Doctrine to ſay, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſinners, as ſinners: but it driveth us not upon any ſuch rocks. We are not neceſſitated therefore to grant his Concluſion, which is, There was need of this imputed righteouſneſs, preventing whatſoever good can be in us, that is, as he meaneth, that we might be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God before we were and had my being, even from eternity. For if imputation of righteouſneſſe, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent whatſoever good can be in us, then it muſt needs prevent, and go before Faith. And ſo it will follow, that our juſtification is an immanent and an eternal Act of God, which this learned Divine will have in Gods conſideration to prevent his loving of us. But, that it is no ſuch immanent Act, is proved afterwards.</p>
                  <p>I find this great learned Divine in another place rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning thus,<note place="margin">De Sola fide juſtificante, <hi>lib. 22. c. 8.</hi>

                     </label> Here are many Propoſitions linked together which I ſhall examine in order. And firſt, whereas he ſaith, Gods love is oppoſed to hatred, To this I anſwer, That Love and hatred in God, as alſo the reſt of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, are the ſame ſingle and undivided eſſence of God: they are not therefore oppoſite as they are in God, but in their Effects, or in their Objects <hi>in quibus contrarie ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur,</hi> in which they work thoſe things, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another. For example juſtification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation are oppoſite Effects of Gods Love, and of his hatred. But it doth not follow hereupon, that becauſe God damneth none but obſtinate ſinners whom he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that he loveth no man unleſſe he be firſt juſtified from his ſins. For though God doth not condemn any, nor hate any but for their ſins; yet he doth <hi>gratis</hi> freely juſtifie, as many as he juſtifieth through his grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any merits of theirs; yea, contrary to the merit of their ſins, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt Learned <hi>Chamier</hi> not only acknowledgeth, but abundantly confirmeth by moſt valid teſtimonies of holy Scripture. <hi>Probat enim juſtificationem effici per cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem Dei, tanquam efficientem cauſam.</hi> For he proveth that our juſtification is through the love of God, as the efficient cauſe thereof, After that the kindneſs, &amp; love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118801:37"/> mercy he ſaved us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 4, 5. God commendeth his love to us, that whereas we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us, Being juſtified therefore by his blood, we ſhall much more be ſaved now by his life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Seeing theſe things are thus alledged and delivered by <hi>Chamie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> himſelf, I wonder that he could ſo far forget himſelf, as after a few lines to ſay, <hi>Deum non amare aliter niſi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſis peccatis,</hi> that God doth not lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e us, unleſſe our ſins be firſt forgiven us. For if it were ſo, How could Gods Love be ſaid to be the efficient cauſe of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For ſure I am, he will not ſay, <hi>Cauſam effectu ſuo poſteriorem eſſe,</hi> that the Cauſe is after its Effect.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, whereas he ſaith, the hatred of God is for the guilt of ſin, therefore as long as the guilt of ſin remaineth, ſo long muſt we needs be hated of God. I grant, that God hateth none but for ſin: but it doth not follow hereupon, that every one is hated of God, as long as the guilt of his ſins doth remain. For then ſeeing the guilt of ſin in all the Elect, doth go before the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, (<hi>Quod enim non eſt, non remittitur,</hi> for that which is not, cannot be ſaid to be forgiven) it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Elect themſelves, as well as others, were once hated of God, and not beloved of him: whereas the Lord himſelf ſaith, That he loved them with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. Thus then it is; God hateth ſin in all, yea in the Elect themſelves: but he pitied their perſons, and loved them from all eternity, as they were his Creatures, and, out of this his love, provided for them a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then this moſt worthy Divine, concludeth thus, If therefore it behoveth him whom God loveth, not to be guilty of ſin: but there is no man but he is guilty of ſin, unleſſe his ſin be pardoned and forgiven him, that is, unleſſe he be juſtified, and ſo leaveth it to be inferred, that we muſt be juſtified before we can be loved of God; That which I have ſaid already, doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſt the inconſequence hereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this I add further, that where thre is alike guilt, we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118801:38"/> cannot alwaies infer a neceſſity of like condemnation. As for example, a Soveraign Prince, or King, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Subjects are riſen up againſt him in rebellion, and are all alike guilty of death, doth of his mercy and free grace, pardon ſome of them: but others he as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh examples of his juſtice, for terrour unto the reſt of his Subjects, and cauſeth them to be put to death. Even thus it is in this preſent caſe: for whereas all of us for our ſins have deſerved eternal death, God of his grace converteth, abſolveth, and juſtifieth ſome, and others he leaveth in their ſins, and condemneth them according to their demerits. Thus Gods love, or his grace, is the cauſe of our juſtification, and not our juſtification the cauſe of Gods loving us, as hath been ſhewed before, and ſhal now by Gods grace be further proved, <hi>tum ex conceſſis Chamieri,</hi> both from that which <hi>Chamier</hi> granteth and delivereth for truth; and from other places of Scripture, beſide thoſe which I have already produced.</p>

                     <hi>Mors Chriſti eſt vera cauſa justificationis,</hi> ſaith he, The death of Chriſt is the true cauſe of our juſtification. And this indeed is moſt truly ſpoken of him; for our bleſſed Saviour himſelf telleth us, That he ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of our ſins.

                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7.</note> For thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſſe of our ſins.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe ſaith, that <hi>the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſins.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</note> Now, what is this, but for him to ſay, that the forgiveneſs of our ſins, is an effect of Chriſts blood which he ſhed for us? Or, that I may ſpeak in <hi>Chamier's</hi> words, that Chriſts death is the true cauſe of our juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Now from hence, I do firſt inferr, that our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be the cauſe why God loveth us. <hi>Quicquid enim eſt cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati;</hi> For whatſoever is the cauſe of the cauſe, is alſo the cauſe of that which is cauſed by that cauſe. Now Gods love was the cauſe why he ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118801:38"/> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. Our propitiation therefore, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our juſtification, which is therewith neceſſarily connexed, or which is involved in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. cannot be the cauſe of Gods love, for then Gods love ſhould both be the cauſe and the effect of our propitiation and juſtification by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, if Chriſts death be (as it is indeed) the true cauſe of our juſtification, then we cannot be actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified <hi>ab aeterno</hi> from all eternity. <hi>Temporale enim non eſt cauſa aeterni,</hi> for that which is in a definite time, cannot be the cauſe of that which hath been for ever. But Chriſt ſuffered for our ſins, <hi>non ab aeterno; ſed tempore à Deo definito,</hi> not from eternity; but at that time which God had determined, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. His Paſſion therefore, either muſt not be the cauſe of our juſtification, or if we ſhall ſay that it is, as this moſt learned Divine, and all other (for any thing that I know to the contrary) do: we muſt needs grant, that we were not actually juſtified <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> from all eternity, but in time.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. that We are juſtified by the redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through Faith in his blood: from hence alſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that our ſins are actually pardoned, and we ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from them in time, and not from all eternity. For it cannot be ſaid of our Election (and there is the ſame reaſon of every other immanent, and eternal Act of God) that we were elected through the redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, as a cauſe thereof. For our Election is immediatly of Gods grace, and not effected by any external means, or for any external cauſe, <hi>extra Deum</hi> without God himſelf, no more then are <hi>opera ulla ejus ad intrà</hi> any of his internal acts, or works. For as much therefore, as the Apoſtle teacheth, That we are juſtified by the redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, unto me it ſeemeth very evident, that our juſtification can be none of the immanent and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118801:39"/> eternal works of God, that are acted altogether within himſelf.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> I know, there are thoſe that do object againſt this that I have ſaid, thoſe words of St <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13 where he telleth them, That God had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, choſen them unto ſalvation through ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, and belief of the truth. But his meaning is not, That ſanctification of the Spirit, and Faith of the truth, were any cauſes, no nor means of their Election, but of their ſalvation; as if he ſhould have ſaid, God hath from the beginning choſen you unto ſalvation, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed and poſſeſſed of you, by being ſanctified by Gods Spirit, and by believing in Chriſt, as by means leading thereunto. Thus the Apoſtle, in ſaying he hath choſen you unto ſalvation, that is, to obtain ſalvation by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth, maketh theſe means, of their ſalvation not of their Election. Yea not only the Orthodox Proteſtant Divines, but Popiſh Doctors alſo do thus expound theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> amongſt whom <hi>Estius</hi> commenteth thus upon them. The effects of Gods Election, ordained unto ſalvation are hereby ſignified; as if he ſhould ſay, God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you; or hath taken you unto ſalvation, by means thereunto allotted, to wit, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and Faith of the truth. <hi>Theophylact</hi> alſo (alledged by him) thus expoundeth theſe words, God hath from the beginning, that is, from eternity, choſen you unto ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, that is, (ſaith he) he hath ſaved us in ſanctifying us by the Spirit. Thus our ſalvation is by means, but our Election is the immediate work, or act of God whereof there can no cauſe or reaſon be given, <hi>niſi bene placitum Divinum,</hi> but Gods own gracious good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>This that I have thus taught, is the Doctrine of the moſt Orthodox Divines. I cannot therefore but wonder, what ſhould move the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Chamier</hi> to ſay, <hi>quòd amari mereamur à Deo per imputationem juſtitiae Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, et quôd inde diligamur, et deſtinemur vitae aeternae,</hi> that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118801:39"/> we deſerve to be loved of God through the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and that thereupon we are beloved and allotted, or elected unto eternal life. This, I ſay, ſeemeth unto me, a moſt ſtrange aſſertion: for hence it would follow, that Gods Love and his Election, were not free, or altogether gratuitous. But God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto his Church and people ſaith <hi>dilexi te gratis,</hi> I <hi>have loved thee freely.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that <hi>God hath predeſtinated us to the adoption of ſons by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle alſo ſaith, that the Election of Gods people, is of grace.</p>
                  <p>Now merit and free love and grace cannot ſtand together. Chriſt indeed hath merited all the ſaving ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Gods Love: <hi>at, dilectio ipſamet Dei eſt gratuitae,</hi> but Gods love it ſelf is not merited, but free. He loveth us meerly <hi>ex beneplacito ſuo,</hi> of his good pleaſure. This love of his is the cauſe why he gave us his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son to work our ſalvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. This love of his therefore muſt needs be the cauſe alſo of all Chriſts merits, both of our redemption, juſtification, adoption, ſanctification, and glorification. Neither our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore, nor any other of theſe can be the cauſe of Gods love, if we ſhall ſpeak properly of his love, and not of ſome one or other effects thereof. But proceed we to the next thing, wherein <hi>Chamierus</hi> diſſenteth from that which is moſt commonly taught by other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, concerning our juſtification.</p>
                  <p>This learned man alſo teacheth, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine of the Proteſtants, that there are no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations unto our juſtification. Now if it were, as he ſaith, that our juſtification is an eternal Act of God, this would neceſſarily follow. But ſeeing we are not actually juſtified until we do believe in Chriſt, and are not ordinarily brought to renounce our ſelves, and to put the whole confidence of our ſalvation in Chriſt, until we be wrought upon, and prepared thereunto both by the Law and the Goſpel, as is to be ſhewed in the next Queſtion: therefore ſeeing he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118801:40"/> nothing that I have met with, for confirmation of this his aſſertion, I will leave the further examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſifting of it unto its due place.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I come to the laſt thing, that by the learned <hi>Chamierus</hi> is aſſerted in oppoſition to the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Proteſtants, and that is, That we are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith in Chriſt: for he ſpeaketh expreſly and ſaith, <hi>falſum eſt fidem impetrare juſtificationem,</hi> It's falſe that Faith obtaineth juſtification. For confirmation whereof he reaſoneth thus,</p>
                  <p>If it were ſo, then Faith ſhould go before our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in reaſon, and in time, which may by no means be granted. For Faith it ſelf, is by it ſelf a part of our ſanctification; but there is no ſanctification, but it is after juſtification, which in deed, and in nature, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. Which is the cauſe why we do ſay, that Faith doth no otherwiſe juſtifie but relatively, that is, becauſe it hath for its peculiar object the mercy of God, on which it relieth: Now this is that properly that juſtifieth, as the Church is built relatively upon the Faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, upon Chriſt, whom the Faith of <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>That I may examine theſe things in order, as they lie. Firſt, whereas he ſaith, If Faith ſhould obtain our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then Faith ſhould go before our juſtification, both in reaſon, and in time. I deny this conſequence, for from hence it followeth only, that Faith goeth before our juſtification in order of nature, or in reaſon; but not in time, becauſe a man is juſtified at the ſame inſtant that he layeth hold on Chriſt, &amp; believeth in him. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, that Faith goeth before our juſtification in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at all, &amp; his reaſon is, becauſe Faith is a part of our ſanctification: but there is no ſanctification, but it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter juſtification, which indeed and in nature is before it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Propoſitions, I do willingly grant, that Faith is a part of ſanctification: but whereas he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth, that there is noſanctification, but it is after juſtification, I cannot aſſent unto him in this. For many worthy Divines do hold, that ſanctification is before ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118801:40"/> their judgment therefore, I might oppoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the learned <hi>Chamiers,</hi> &amp; others that hold the contrary: For the clearing of this matter, I do diſtinguiſh of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſay, that it is either habitual, and ſo God doth ſanctifie us by infuſing holineſſe into us; or actual and ſo we do ſanctifie our ſelves by renouncing the works of ſin, and living holily. Of both theſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God, and ye ſhall keep my Statutes and do them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.7.8.</note> 
                     <hi>for I am the Lord which ſanctifie you.</hi> When the Lord ſaith here, <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves and be ye holy;</hi> this muſt be underſtood of actual ſanctification, that is, of holineſs that is to be actually performed by us. But whereas the Lord uſeth this as a reaſon to ſtir us up hereunto, <hi>[for I am the Lord which ſanctifie you]</hi> this is ſpoken of habitual ſanctification. For how doth the Lord ſanctifie us, but by infuſing the habit, or the internal grace of holineſſe into us, whereby we are inabled to perform the ſeveral acts of holineſſe, or to live holily, the effectual excitation of Gods bleſſed Spirit herewith concurring. But becauſe theſe words of the Lord, which I have alledged, though they ſpeak of a twofold ſanctification, are taken in another ſenſe by very learned Divines, than this that I have given: for confirmation therefore of habitual ſanctification, I do alledge thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. where he prayeth, that God would ſanctify them wholly, or throughly. And thoſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. where he ſaith, That Chriſt is made unto us ſanctification, See alſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Now of actual ſanctification St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh when he ſaith, <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctification, that ye ſhould abſtain from fornication: that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: not in the luſt of concupiſcence, even as the Gentiles which know not God.</hi> Hereof alſo ſpeaketh St. <hi>Peter</hi> in that precept of his, <hi>Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.</hi> In theſe, and in other places, the Scripture ſpeaketh of Sanctification both habitual wrought in us by God; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of ſanctification acted, and wrought by us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118801:41"/> through the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, exciting us unto holineſſe. Whereas then this moſt learned Divine ſaith, That there is no ſanctification but it is after juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, this is true, if it be underſtood of actual ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For we are firſt juſtified by Faith, and then this Faith inflameth our hearts with the love of God, and ſtirreth us up to glorifie him, and to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs, according to all his commandements.</p>
                  <p>Thus the ſeveral works of holineſs and righteouſneſs, do proceed from Faith, <hi>Etiamſi non elicitivè, imperativè tamen,</hi> though not elicitly, yet imperatively, Faith ſtirreth us up unto them. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is love, out of a pure heart, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>and Faith unfeigned.</hi> It is true therefore, that Faith and therefore juſtification, which is thereby laid hold of, and obtained, is before actual ſanctification. For (as this learned man ſaith well) <hi>fides vera eſt fons et ſcaturigo omnium bonorum operum in fidelibus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De ſola fide juſtificante, <hi>Lib. 22. cap. 12.</hi>
                     </note> True Faith is the fountain and ſource of all good works in the faithful. But I cannot ſay that there is no ſanctification, but it is after juſtification: for habitual Faith is a part of habitual anctification. Now the infuſed habits of grace, ſuch as Faith is, are before their acts. If therefore it can be proved, that <hi>adulti,</hi> or ſuch as are of capacity and underſtanding, are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without, or before actual Faith, then it will inevitably follow, that there is ſome ſanctification, that is not after juſtification. Yea, (beſide what hath been ſaid already, to prove that we are actually juſtified by Faith and not without it) methinketh <hi>Chamierus</hi> himſelf doth as good as grant it, when he ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erum est, proptereà nos factos in Chriſto juſtitiam Dei, quòd Chriſto nos ſimus incorporati per fidem;</hi> It is true that we are therefore made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God in Chriſt, becauſe we are incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him by Faith. We are not then juſtified before Faith, or before we do believe in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, this moſt excellent Divine ſaith, <hi>In adultis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temur remiſſionem peccatorum ab inhaerente juſtitiâ nunquam
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118801:41"/> ſepaerari,</hi> We confeſs, that remiſſion of ſins is never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from inherent righteouſneſs in thoſe that are grown in years. But, ſay I, many of the Elect after they have the uſe of reaſon and underſtanding, being well grown in years, do yet live in ſin for ſome time, and do not ſerve God in righteouſneſs, until he by his grace doth afterward convert them. According therefore to his own Doctrine, it followeth, that juſtification from ſin, at leaſt in <hi>adultis,</hi> in thoſe that are grown in years, doth not go before Faith; But, ſaith he. Faith juſtifieth <hi>relativè,</hi> as it hath for its proper &amp; peculiar object the mercy of God, on which it relieth. Whence (as I conceive) he would have it inferred, That ſeeing the mercy of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, therefore our juſtification is ſo alſo, and therefore before Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now hereunto I anſwer, that though Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe be <hi>materialiter</hi> the proper object of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or that which is imputed to us for our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet I will not deny, bur that Gods mercy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the internal cauſe moving God to juſtify us, may thus be ſaid to be the proper, and peculiar object on which our Faith relyeth for juſtification. But it doth not follow hereupon, that we were juſtified <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> from everlaſting, becauſe Gods mercy is the cauſe of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: no more than that we are ſanctified and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied eternally, becauſe our ſanctification and glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are wholly of Gods mercy:</p>

                  <p>THoſe that take upon them to be the only Preachers of Free-grace, do condemn us, who teach that men muſt repent and believe, if they will be ſaved, for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch qualifications and preparations in them.

                  <p>And Mr. S. ſaith, That Chriſt is offered to ſinners as ſinners, and that no qualification is required of them, that they may be ſaved by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reconcil. of God to man, pag. <hi>40.</hi>
                     </note>Mr. D. alſo telleth us, That a man is to believe, that God is his Father in Chriſt, without any precedent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
                  <p>Thus do they teach: but we think it not good to ſpeak thus confuſedly of this matter, knowing that many by theſe and the like ſpeeches, which they meet with in theſe mens writings, are led into moſt dangerous errors. To avoid therefore miſtaking, we ſay, that ſalvation may be taken either <hi>pro ſalute inchoatâ,</hi> or <hi>conſummatâ,</hi> that is, either for our ſalvation as it is begun in us, in our regeneration, or in our converſion from ſin to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and from infidelity or incredulity, to Faith in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118801:42"/> Chriſt; or elſe for our ſalvation, as it ſhall be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and perfected in us in heaven. If we ſhall ſpeak o ſalvation in the former ſenſe, we do not ſay, That Faith and Repentance are precedent qualifications or previous qualifications, or previous diſpoſitions unto it; for then we ſhould be ſaid to be ſaved, before we are ſaved; or ſaved and not ſaved, which is a manifeſt contradiction. For our ſalvation is begun in our converſion to God by Repentance and Faith in Chriſt. It is no new light, but the conſtant Doctrine formerly taught, as well as now, by all Orthodox Proteſtants, that <hi>homo in primo puncto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſionis ſuae ſe habeat mere paſſivè, et obedientialiter,</hi> that is, that man in the firſt inſtant of his converſion, is no actor, but a receiver of grace, wrought in him by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; but in the next inſtant, <hi>actus agit,</hi> being thus acted, or wrought upon by God, he alſo acteth, or co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth, and worketh with God. And yet though we do conſtantly teach thus, we do not reject all previous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, or preparations to ſaving grace, or to the very firſt beginning of our ſalvation in our converſion to God, &amp; to Chriſt. For the Law,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21.</note> muſt ordinarily firſt be preached unto ſinners, to prepare and make way for the Goſpel; <hi>For by the Law cometh the knowledge of ſin.</hi> As long as men are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof, they are ready to rely on themſelves, &amp; do not ſee that they ſtand in any great need of Chriſt, as it is to be ſeen in our ignorant people, who put the confidence of their ſalvation, not in Chriſt only, and in his merits, but in their good prayers, &amp; good ſerving of God, and good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, boaſting and bragging, that they ſerve God truly, and keep all his commandements. Now our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, offereth not himſelf unto ſuch juſtitiaries, as ſuch, or while they continue ſuch: but rejecteth them,<note place="margin">

And in the ſame ſenſe he telleth us,<note place="margin">

Such poor and ſuch diſtreſſed ſinners therefore they are, whom Chriſt inviteth unto him, and promiſeth to relieve them, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">

Concerning which our own learned Divines, at the Synod at <hi>Dort,</hi> in their <hi>Suffragium Collegiale</hi> do ſpeak excellently. I'le therefore ſet down their words at large, as they are delivered in two diſtinct <hi>Theſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. <hi>There are certain outward works ordinarily required of men, before they are brought to the eſtate of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Converſion, which are wont ſometimes to be freely done by them, and ſometimes freely omitted; as to go to the Church, to hear the word preached, and others of the like ſort.</hi>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt that ſuch are required. <hi>How ſhall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, of whom they have not heard.</hi> Now that theſe are in our own power, both reaſon telleth us, ſeeing every
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118801:43"/> one hath ability to move, or not to move from place to place; and experience proveth it, ſeeing we ſee that men in outward things, do either do this or that, as they think good, or omit them both. They may ſit ſtill at home there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they ſhould go to the Church, &amp; they may ſtop their ears when the Miniſter is preaching the Goſpel.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>There are certain internal effects previous unto a mans Converſion, or Regeneration, which by the power of Gods Word and Spirit, are excited in the hearts of men, as yet not juſtified; ſuch as the knowledge of Gods Will, the ſenſe of ſin, the fear of puniſhment, thoughts about their deliverance, and ſome hopes of pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God by his grace is not wont to bring men to the ſtate of juſtification, wherein we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſudden enthuſiaſm; but being firſt ſubdued, and prepared with many previous actions, in the miniſtery of the word. This we may ſee in thoſe who upon the hearing of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, feel the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin, are afraid, do mourn, deſire deliverance, and conceive ſome hope of pardon;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.</note> all which may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of thoſe words, <hi>When they had heard theſe things, they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>and the other Apoſtles, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> This is the very nature of the thing required. For as in the naturall generation of a man, there are many previous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which go before the introduction of the form; ſo alſo in the ſpiritual, by many antecedent actions of grace, do we come to our ſpiritual maturity. This laſtly, is apparent by the inſtruments, which God uſeth in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating men: for he uſeth the miniſtery of men, and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118801:44"/> inſtrument of the word,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>I have begotten you by the Goſpel,</hi> But if God would immediatly regenerate and juſtifie a wicked man, prepared hereunto with no ſorrow, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, no hope of pardon, there would be no need, neither of the miniſtery of men, nor of the word preached, for the effecting thereof, neither need the Miniſters to take any care to divide the word aright, firſt by wounding the conſciences of their hearers, aptly and prudently with the terrours of the Law, and afterwards by raiſing rhem up with the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and exhorting them to ſeek Repentance and Faith of God, by prayers and tears. Thus far, thoſe worthy Divines.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.17.</note> when he had carried away the ten Tribes, brought from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and other places to inhabit the Cities of <hi>Samaria,</hi> inſtead of the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For as thoſe heathen people, when one of the Prieſts of the captivated <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was by the King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> ſent unto them to inſtruct them, how the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was to be worſhipped; are ſaid after this to have borh worſhipped the Lord, and the gods of thoſe Nations whence they came. So if the Goſpel only be preached, to men before they have been brought by the Law to ſee what miſerable ſinners they are, they hearing, that Chriſt by his death hath redeemed us from hell, and purchaſed Heaven for us, may readily receive him for their Saviour, and profeſſe his name: but ſo, that they will ſtill retain the ſame ignorant and proud conceit of their own good deeds, and good deſerving as they did before, For
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118801:46"/> ſo we ſee many of our people that are ignorant of the Law, in words to acknowledge Chriſt for their Saviour, and yet if they be asked how they hope to be ſaved, they will tell you, for their good prayers, and for their good meaning, and good ſerving of God. And thus indeed all men naturally, are ready to rely upon themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by the Law they come to ſee their ſins, and the great wrath that is hanging over their heads for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Law was firſt given, and, after that man had tranſgreſſed it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</note> the Goſpel, or evangelical Promiſe of ſalvation by Chriſt, was made known unto him: So the Law is firſt to be preached unto men, and ſet before them as a looking-glaſſe, that they may by comparing themſelves with it, ſee their ſins, and ſee and perceive in what a woful ſtate and condition they are. And when they are humbled and do renounce and deny themſelves altogether, acknowledging that if God ſhould enter into judgement with them, they muſt needs be damned to the everlaſting torments of hell: now is the Goſpel to be preached unto them, and Jeſus Chriſt and the merits of his grace are in their excellency &amp; greateſt luſter, to be ſet forth before them. For now when they are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſight &amp; ſenſe of their ſins, and of that woful condition wherein they are becauſe of them, they will highly eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt, and long, and thirſt after him, and deſirouſly lay hold on him, and renouncing all other means of ſalvation, will reſt themſelves only on him. Yea, now, the more miſerable they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, the more will they magnifie the riches of Gods mercy in their ſalvation by Chriſt, and the more ardently, and affectionately will they love Chriſt, and ſtudy and ſtrive, to be ſo much the more thankful unto him for their ſalvation all their daies. For, what is it that enlargeth the heart in thankfulneſs, but an hearty acknowledgment of the greatneſs of the benefit, that is done us? As long therefore as a man is ignorant of his ſins, and of the danger that he is in by the means of them, he can never acknowledge how greatly he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118801:46"/> and beholding unto Chriſt, for his redemption and ſalvation, and therefore he can never truly love him, as he ought, nor be truly thankful unto him. You ſee then how neceſſary it is, that the Law ſhould be taught, as well as the Goſpel.</p>

                     </label> That if any did preach the Law alone without the Goſpel, or if they offer Chriſt unto their hearers, upon condition that they do exactly fulfil the Law, and ſo urge and preſſe it on them, as it is the Covenant of works, by the practice and performance whereof, and no otherwiſe ſalvation is to be had; no doubt in thus preaching the Law, they may drive ſome into deſperation, and hinder others from Faith in Chriſt; but ſhall never be a means of the converſion of any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man living can obſerve the Law, to be juſtified by it. Yea, I will ſay more, if any do preach the Law to thoſe, who have <hi>timoratas conſcientias,</hi> tender and trembling conſciences, which are ſo caſt down with the ſight and ſenſe of their ſins, that it is high time to poure the oyl of joy, and the balm of the Goſpel into their contrite &amp; broken hearts, ſuch undiſcreet preaching of the Law, cannot but be a great means to weaken Faith, where it is wrought already, and to hinder others from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who by the comfortable Promiſes of the Goſpel, might be incouraged to lay hold of Chriſt by Faith, and to caſt themſelves confidently on him for their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But though this be ſo, yet the preaching of the Law, is as neceſſary to humble thoſe that ſee not their ſins, and the danger of them, but live ſecurely in them; that ſo deſpairing of ſalvation in themſelves, they may ſeek it by Chriſt only.</p>
                  <p>Again, after that men do deny themſelves, and their own works altogether, and rely only on Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although the Law is not to be preſſed on them, as it is a Covenant of works, nor preached in the full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

In this regard the moral Law (for of that only I ſpeak) is not abrogated, but ſubordinated unto the Goſpel, yea, and after a ſort incorporated into it. For all the duties of the moral Law, may be reduced to theſe three heads, 1. Piety towards God. 2. Juſtice or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs towards a mans neighbour. And thirdly, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, or temperance in ordering of himſelf. Now all theſe the Goſpel preſcribeth and requireth, as well as the Law.<note place="margin">

                        </label> that it is one thing to ſay as our Saviour doth, that <hi>Faith is the work of God,</hi> and another thing, that it is the only work of God, or of the Goſpel, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> avoucheth. For when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>this is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he hath ſent,</hi> his meaning is, (as St. <hi>John</hi> in the latter place alledged by him, expreſſeth it) that Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is a work commanded and required of us by God. Now ſo is repentance alſo, for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30; <hi>Now,</hi> that is, in theſe daies of grace, <hi>the Lord commandeth all men every where,</hi> to wit, to whom the Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <hi>to repent.</hi> The Lord alſo in the Goſpel comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth good works, as neceſſary effects and fruits both of Faith and Repentance. <hi>For Faith worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.

                     <p>By theſe places it appeareth, that there are other works commanded of God in the Goſpel, beſide Faith, and that as Faith hath its neceſſary uſes, ſo have they alſo theirs. It doth not follow therefore, becauſe Faith is called the work of God, nor becauſe it is ſaid, this is his Commandement, that we believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that it is the only work of the Goſpel, as Mr. S. inferreth; for St. <hi>John</hi> even in the place which he alledgeth, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame of charity, and ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Faith is alſo called the work of God, not as if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Repentance, and all other good works, were either to be contemned, or neglected; but becauſe it is the only act, or work preſcribed us by God, whereby we are to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

                     <p>Hereunto I anſwer, That ſeeing Gods glory is to be preferred before our own ſalvation, therefore we ought both to deſire, and to endeavour, were it poſſible, to do not as much, but more for what is done for us already, as if we were to be ſaved by what we do our ſelves.

But he that ſhall challenge ſuch perfection to himſelf, is to be ranked amongſt proud Phariſees, and deſerveth not the name of an humble, and lowly hearted Chriſtian. For a farewel therefore to this firſt reaſon of his, I would know how Faith can be the only work of the Goſpel, if the Goſpel do teach us to do as much in way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God for our redemption, and ſalvation, as if we were to redeem, and ſave our ſelves.</p>

                     <p>Now, how Mr. S, will frame an Argument, either from the Apoſtles, or from our Saviours words againſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118801:52"/> preparations before Faith, I know not, unleſſe it be thus. God loved all equally, loved them to make them partakers of Chriſt, and of ſalvation by him; therefore in preaching the Goſpel, nothing is to be required of any, but all are to believe, that they ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, whether they be penitent for ſin, or rejoyce and delight in ſin; and whether they purpoſe, and reſolve to leave ſin, or to live in ſin. Now I grant indeed, That this Concluſion were to be admitted, if the antecedent whence it is deduced were true, that is, if God did love all abſolutely unto their eternal ſalvation, and had no purpoſe to work any change or alteration in them, while they live here. But this is palpably falſe, for whom God loveth eternally, and before all time, they receive in time through the gracious operation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the neceſſary effects of this his love, that is contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and compunction of heart for ſin, Faith in Chriſt for the forgiveneſſe of ſin, converſion to God from all ſin, and all other ſaving graces, to the accompliſhment of their their ſalvation. It's falſe therefore, that ſinners are only to believe, that God loveth them, and that they are reconciled unto him by Chriſts death, as Mr. D. and Mr. S. do teach, and that nothing elſe, but ſuch a bare Faith is to be required of them, that they may thereby know, and be aſſured, that they are juſtified, and partakers of Chriſt. For God loveth not all unto ſalvation; but the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whom in time he bringeth by degrees to the poſſeſſion of that ſalvation, by preparing them for it in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the Goſpel teacheth, and letteth none lie ſtill rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their ſins, without any true Faith, or Repentance, but only wicked reprobates, whom he ſuffereth to walk in the broad way, that leadeth unto deſtruction.</p>

                     <p>He farther urgeth, It exalteth Grace more to receive a ſinner, who hath no mony, no price, no righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>His meaning is, That it maketh more to the glory of Gods grace, that he receive ſinners as ſinners, without any ſorrow for, or ſenſe and feeling of their ſins, rather than humbled and broken-hearted ſinners, that ſee and perceive how miſerable they are in themſelves, and in what great need they do ſtand of a Saviour.</p>
                     <p>But I anſwer him, That maketh moſt to the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exalting of Gods grace, which he himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and preſcribeth; and not which ſinful men in their carnal, and fleſhly wiſdom do fancy and like beſt, or which they judge to be moſt for the ſetting forth of his grace. Now it is evident, that God offereth Chriſt to none, but to thoſe that acknowledge their ſins, and feel the burden of them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. Yea, even that very place which Mr. S. alledgeth, proveth againſt him, that ſome preparations go before Faith in Chriſt, to wit, a thirſting after him, and his graces, which cannot be unleſſe a man feel his miſery by ſin, and ſee in what need he ſtandeth of Chriſt; even as a man never thirſteth corporally, until he is pained with heat, and dryneſſe, and feeleth in what need he ſtandeth of drink. Theſe very words therefore of the prophet <hi>Iſay, Ho eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mony: come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without mony and without price,</hi> are produced by him againſt himſelf. For all are not here invited to come to Chriſt, and to be made partakers of his graces, not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as ſinners, as he will have it, that is ſinners continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſins, without any purpoſe to leave them, yea
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118801:53"/> not ſo much as acknowledging their ſins, and their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by means of them: but firſt, ſuch ſinners, who feeling their great need of Chriſt, do thirſt after him; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuch as have no mony, and therefore do offer no price for him; that is, who do acknowledge that they have no merits of their own, nor can do any thing to purchaſe, or procure Gods favour. Having thus wreſted his weapon out of his hands, and turned it againſt himſelf. I muſt now tell him, that whereas he ſaith, That it exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth grace more, to receive a ſinner that hath no money, no price, no righteouſneſſe, that is, in his ſenſe, all ſorts of ſinners, though they do not ſo much as feel nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſins; rather then thoſe, that being caſt down with the ſight and ſenſe of their ſins, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have no money, no price, nor no righhteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their own; I muſt (I ſay) tell him, that he is much deceived in this; for firſt, it ſtandeth not with Gods juſtice, and his hatred of ſin, to pardon ſinners without working any change in them at all; but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to continue, and remain ſtill in their ſins. The holy Prophet <hi>David</hi> diſclaimeth this, and ſpeaketh againſt him when he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſſe neither ſhall evil dwell with thee. The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, I ſay further, Gods grace is moſt exalted when ſinners do moſt acknowledge the riches of his grace, and are moſt thankful to him for it. Now ſo are they, who do moſt feel the burden of their ſins, and do moſt apprehend their ſpiritual miſery, as it is to be ſeen in the penitent woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47.</note> the ſight and ſenſe of whoſe many and great ſins made her greatly to love Chriſt. But on the contrary, if God ſhould pardon thoſe that feel not their ſins, but are whole in their own conceit, they would either with the Phariſees, aſcribe their ſalvation more to their own works, then to Gods grace, or turn the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe, and wax wanton againſt Chriſt, as Libertines and carnal Goſpellers do,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118801:54"/> who rely ſo much on the grace of God, that they have no care to live holily and righteouſly, to the glory of Gods grace, but by their wicked works and deeds of darkneſſe, <hi>do cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed. Rom.</hi> 2.24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1.</p>

                     <p>Another of Mr. S. his Objections in this, It's right lifting up of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, not for the healed to look upon, <label type="milestone">

                     <p>But whom doth he here reaſon againſt, not the ancient and Orthodox Proteſtant, for the preparation which they require, to a ſinners converſion, and to his Faith in Chriſt, is that he do feel the ſpiritual ſickneſſes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of his ſoul. Now ſhall we ſay, as he doth, that this is to be healed. I trow, as long as one feeleth himſelf ſick, he is not healed. But I take it, his meaning is, though by his words he doth not ſo well expreſs it, That the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> that were ſtung with fiery Serpents, were to do nothing for the recovery of their health, but to look up unto the braſen Serpent; therefore we alſo are only by Faith to look up unto Chriſt, and to believe in him, that we may be ſaved, without any other preparations.

If any had been inſenſibly bitten by one of thoſe Serpents, ſo that he had felt no ſmart, nor no pain at all, he would have taken himſelf to have been well, and would never have had any recourſe to the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent at all. And even in like ſort, it is the ſenſe, and feeling of ſin, and of the burden and miſery of it, that driveth men unto Chriſt, and maketh them to rely on him for ſalvation; for ſuch, as feel not their ſins, do ſleep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in them, without any fear, and do not perceive, that they ſtand in any great need of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do reſt and rely on themſelves much more then they do on him.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the terrours of the Law are neceſſary, by way of preparation hereunto. For how can a man ſe of apprehend the great love of God to him, in giving his Son to death for his Redemption? if by the terrors of the law, he be not firſt made to ſee in what a wofull caſe and condition he was by his ſins, to wit, that he ſhould have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and been damned to unſpeakable and unconceivable torments in Hell, if God out of his ſurpaſſing love, pity, and compaſſion towards him, had not provided and given him a Saviour.

                  <p>Firſt, he telleth us, That a man never ſavingly ſeeth his evil condition without Chriſt. And again, That it is the Spirit of God that diſcovereth ſin unto him. Now the preaching of the Law bringeth not this Spirit, but the hearing of Faith, as witneſſeth St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>But here firſt, I would know of him, why he ſaith, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> a man never ſavingly knoweth his evil condition without Chriſt? For our ſalvation conſiſteth not in knowing of our evil condition, but in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. For a man to know his evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by ſin, is to know that damnation is due unto him for his ſin. Now many a man hath attained to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; who was never ſaved. Salvation therefore doth not at all conſiſt in this, but in a mans flying unto Chriſt, and laying hold of him, when he ſeeth how miſerable his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is become through ſin. Now whereas he alledgeth the Apoſtles words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. to prove, that a man is not brought by the preaching of the Law, but of Faith, to be made partaker of the Spirit, without which he cannot ſee his miſerable condition by ſin.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer him, That the Apoſtle ſpeaks there, partly of the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, which were by God beſtowed on none but thoſe that had heard the Goſpel, and made profeſſion of Faith, in Chriſt; and partly of the Spirit of adoption, which alſo is peculiar to believers. Now thus indeed we do not receive the Spirit by the preaching of the Law: but otherwiſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</note> as the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118801:59"/> giveth us elſewhere to underſtand, we did by the Law receive the Spirit of bondage to fear. His meaning is, that the Spirit of God, which we received from him, illightning our minds with the true knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Law, did fill our hearts with fears and terrours, and ſo did put us as it were, in a ſtate of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, at, or before our converſion unto Faith in Chriſt. We have need therefore of the illumination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we may throughly underſtand the Law. For as long as men are left to themſelves their very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law, is but ſhallow and ſuperficial, as it to be ſeen in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and in all thoſe, who are only civilly honeſt, which ſort of men are either not at all, or but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled in their ſouls and conſciences with the fear of their ſins or of hell and damnation.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then Mr. C. ſaith, The Apoſtle was once alive without the Law, that is, without the ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Law, but when the Commandement came ſin revived, and he died, that is, when Chriſt had opened his eyes to ſee into the ſpirit of the Law, (the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe thereof I trow he meaneth). In all this I do agree with him: but not in that which followeth, when he addeth, That we come thus to know the ſpiritual underſtanding of the Law, only by the preaching of the Goſpel. For I have already proved the contrary, to wit, that when the Law is preached, men come to underſtand it by the illumination of the Spirit, opening their minds to ſee the true meaning of the ſeveral precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

                     </label> It is the ſight and knowledge of Chriſt, that brings men truly to ſee and know themſelves (not as they are in the eſtate of grace, he meaneth not ſo, but as they are in the eſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) for proof whereof he ſaith, <hi>Saul Acts</hi> 9. thought himſelf a very holy, and happy man till he met Chriſt in the way.

Thou hadſt more need know thy ſelf, &amp;c. No, no, he diſcovereth Himſelf unto him. And this I know was Gods uſual dealing in the Goſpel, thoſe whom he taught, he taught them firſt to know Chriſt, and this Chriſt our Prophet muſt teach thee if ever thou be taught. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>But I would know, whether the Lord did not take another courſe with <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was fallen? Sure I am, he firſt brought him to the ſight and ſenſe of his ſin and miſery, by reproving him for the tranſgreſſion of his Law, before he comforted him, &amp; raiſed him up with that Evangelical promiſe, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the ſerpent.</hi> And our bleſſed Saviour layeth it down for a general rule and direction, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. That repentance and remiſſion of ſins muſt be preached in his name amongſt all nations. Firſt, repentance, which cannot be without the knowledge of ſin, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, by Faith in Chriſt. Now as for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Sauls</hi> converſion, which Mr. C. ſo much, and ſo often urgeth, it is not true which he ſaith, as it were triumphantly; "Chriſt did not tell him of his ſin, O, thou art an accurſed perſecuting creature, &amp;c. For did he not plainly ſpeak unto him and ſay, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118801:60"/> thou me?</hi> And again, <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſecutest. It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</hi> It's evident, that he did as manifeſtly, and as ſoon, if not before, tell him of his ſin in perſecuting him, as he told him, that he was Jeſus. We may conclude therefore from hence, that a man muſt be brought to know himſelf, and his miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate and condition by ſin, either at the ſame time, or before that Chriſt is preached and offered unto him. But of this more hereafter, only I will ſay this now, that <hi>Paul</hi> was terrified and caſt down indeed, by thoſe terrible words of Chriſt, and by beholding his glorious Majeſty: but for the perfecting of his converſion, Chriſt ſent him to <hi>Ananias,</hi> by whom he was to be taught, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he was to do. By him therefore he was taught all things neceſſary unto his ſalvation, and ſo was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and raiſed up again by Faith in Chriſt from his former terrours, and fears. I ſay therefore, as Mr. C. doth, It is Chriſt in the preaching of the Goſpel, that is glad tidings for ſinners, remiſſion of ſins for believers; and this Goſpel, this glad tydings cannot rightly be held forth unto the world, but withal men muſt be ſhewed that they are ſinners, and the emptineſs of duties, and of all other foundations muſt be diſcovered, and the danger of not accepting Chriſt. But I demand, whether this is not to be done, by ſhewing unto men their ſins by the Law, and their diſability to do any thing of themſelves, that is pleaſing unto God, through the corruption that is in them by the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> For this impotency of doing good, and the great wrath that is due unto us for our ſins, the Law re ealeth and maketh known unto us; which when a ſinner once apprehendeth, then the Goſpel is to be preached, and he is to be exhorted to lay hold of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by Faith, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> as the only means of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>But let us examine another of Mr. C's. Arguments, and ſee whether there be any more force in that, <hi>Beloved</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God hath appointed the Spirit to be the means in the preaching of the Goſpel, to convince the world of ſin. Joh.</hi> 16.9.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118801:60"/> 
                     <hi>It is the Spirit of God that convinceth the world of ſin, and that in the preaching of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hereunto I anſwer, that our Saviour ſaith not, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> that the Spirit of God doth in the preaching of the Goſpel only reprove the world of ſin abſolutely, but of the ſin of infidelity: for thus he ſaith, <hi>VVhen the Comforter is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not in me.</hi> Now, what ſhall we ſay, that none believed in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this coming of the Spirit, and reproving of the world of unbelief? Verily no, for the Apoſtles with many other did before this believe in him. For our Saviour ſpeaks here of the coming of the Spirit in the miraculous gifts thereof, as he came upon the Apoſtles, and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and afterwards, until thoſe gifts ceaſed in the Church, when the Goſpel had been by them ſufficiently confirmed. Beſides, the world of which our Saviour there ſpeaketh, though it was convinced of ſin by the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, yet it never belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for our Saviour calleth it the world, that believed not in him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If we ſhould ſay, they were unbelievers and worldlings before, but afterward believed, when they ſaw the miraculous gifts that were by Chriſt poured down and beſtowed on his Apoſtles and others, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their infidelity. yet it cannot hence be inferred, that all in all ſucceeding ages, are thus to be converted and brought unto Faith in Chriſt. But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when I ſhall examine that which he alledgeth out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37;</p>
                  <p>In the next place, he reaſoneth thus, All preparations and qualifications whatſoever, which are not of Faith, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> are ſin; and I am ſure, Faith comes by the preaching of the Goſpel, not of the Law. Therefore the preaching of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications before Faith is ſin: for all things before or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, are ſin. His Reaſon, if we put it in form, will be thus. Sin cannot prepare us for Chriſt, but all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations before Faith are ſin: therefore no ſuch prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or qualifications can prepare us for Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:118801:61"/>
                  <p>Here I would wiſh him firſt of all to conſider, that by reaſoning thus, he ſtriketh himſelf, as well as us. For he will not deny thar the hearing of the Goſpel goeth before Faith; Now, what ſhall we hereupon conclude, that none but believers are to heat the Goſpel? I trow not. For then there will be no hope of any mans converſion from infidelity, or incredulity, to Faith in Chriſt. But that I may ſhew the weakneſs of his reaſoning, Firſt, I grant the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, Sin cannot prepare for Chriſt. The knowledge of ſin may, but not that which is abſolutely, and altogether ſin, or wherein nothing is to be found but ſin; for ſin in this ſenſe, is oppoſite to all goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now, whereas he aſſumeth in the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, and ſaith, But all qualifications before Faith, are ſin. Here I diſtinguiſh of ſin, and ſay, that it is ſo, <hi>vel per ſe, vel per accidens,</hi> either in it ſelf, and its own nature: or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, becauſe being otherwiſe good, through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and unbelief of him that committeth it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſinful and evill, as it proceeds from him. Now of this latter ſort, is the hearing of the word, both of Law and Goſpel, and all preparations wrought before Faith, that is to ſay, legal terrours, confeſſion of ſin, humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hope of pardon, and the like. For theſe are not evil, but good in themſelves, and evil only by accident: therefore in regard of the good that is in them, they through Gods grace do prepare and diſpoſe us unto our converſion, and unto Faith in Chriſt. I do wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Mr. C. ſhould ſay as he doth, not only that all preparations and qualifications going before Faith are ſin: but that the preaching of ſuch before Faith is ſin. Indeed it cannot but be great and groſſe ſin, to preach and to ſtir men up to adultery, whoredom, raſh ſwearing, lying, or to any thing that is ſimply, and in it ſelf ſinful &amp; evil: but otherwiſe, I think, no wiſe man will ſay, that parents ought not to teach their children to know God, and themſelves, to praiſe God, and to perform all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118801:61"/> duties, both to God and man, until they ſhall give good proof that they do believe in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Having thus examined Mr. C.

Unto this his Aſſertion, I do oppoſe that which is to be read in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Sermon unto the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17. wherein he beginneth, and preacheth the Law of nature

It is not true therefore that Chriſt is alwaies firſt to be preached and offered, and that men never come to ſee their ſins, until they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt; but rather on the contrary, by ſeeing of their ſins, they come to ſee the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt.

               <p>But this will not ſerve his turn: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>

                  </label> But let us ſee how Mr. D. endeavoreth to prove that we were the ſons of God before we did believe.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt (ſaith he) declareth ſon-ſhip to be the cauſe of giving the Spirit, when he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſon into your hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> Seeing therefore a man cannot believe without the grace of the Spirit, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth neceſſarily, that we are the ſons of God before we do believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> But hereunto I anſwer, that the Spirit is given diverſly, Firſt, to regenerate us: for we are born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 1.13.</note> but of God, by the powerful operation of his Spirit: Even as our Saviour himſelf alſo teacheth, when he ſaith, <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Spirit is not a conſequent of our regeneration, whereby we are born the ſons of God, but a precedent cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the Spirit is alſo given, to increaſe Faith and holineſſe in us, and to ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh us in grace, after we are regenerated. For as Chriſt by his Spirit beginneth the good work of grace in us, ſo doth he by his Spirit perfect the ſame,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> and not we our ſelves by any power of our own.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, After we are born again, the Spirit is alſo given to comfort us, and to aſſure us of our Adoption by crying in our hearts <hi>Abba</hi> Father.</p>
               <p>Thus (as Mr. D. ſaith) ſon-ſhip, is in ſome ſort the cauſe of giving the Spirit. But otherwiſe we are not ſons, before and without any work of the Spirit at all: for he is the Author, or principal efficient cauſe of our being regenerated, and born again the ſons of God.</p>
               <p>Another of Mr. D's. Objections is this, The Apoſtle ſaith, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>that God the Father hath predestinated us unto the

               <p>Whereunto I anſwer, that he might as well infer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and conclude, that we are alteady glorified, and in actual poſſeſſion of Heaven, For God hath predeſtinated us to be made partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light. It's ſtrange that he cannot diſtinguiſh between the Decree of Election it ſelf, which is eternal, and the effects thereof, that is to ſay, the things whereunto we are Elected, which ſhall be all of them accompliſhed and fulfilled in us, in their due time. When the Apoſtle alſo ſaith, <hi>that God hath choſen us unto ſanctification of the Spirit:</hi> it followeth hence, not that we were actually and really in our own perſons ſanctified from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he reaſoneth; but that we ſhall be ſanctified at that time which God hath decreed and appointed.</p>

                  </label> though not ſo ordinarily as he would have it, yet ſometimes doth call the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things, by the name of the things themſelves; but we muſt not therefore take liberty to ſet this gloſſe upon whatſoever places of Scripture. we ſhall think good our ſelves, as Mr. D. and others now, but too commonly, do.

Thoſe words therfore of both the Apoſtles, are ro be taken in their native ſenſe as they found.

               <p>Whereunto I anſwer, That neither will this prove the eternity of our Adoption, as Mr. D. teacheth it; For Chriſt roſe again at that certain and determinate time
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118801:65"/> which God had decreed, and foretold, that is to ſay, the third day after his Paſſion on the Croſſe. But not to make any uſe of this, whereas St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>that we are begotten again to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> the meaning hereof is not, that we were at that time regenerated, or begotten again, when Chriſt roſe from the dead, unleſſe it were virtually only: but that our regeneration, which is actually wrought, and effected by Gods Word and Spirit, (as was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of all Gods children, from the beginning of the world) depended on Chriſts reſurrection, as on a virtual cauſe, or power producing it, in that time, and by thoſe means which God hath appointed. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians, If Christ be not raiſed, your Faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins.</hi> Thus I have anſwered Mr. D.'s Objections, and (as I take it) ſufficiently clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this matter.</p>

For as it is not to one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall act of faith onely, ſo neither of repentance nor of prayer; but to perſeverance and continuance in all theſe, that God hath promiſed and granted pardon. This is to ſeen in <hi>David,</hi> for after his ſins were pardoned, and he the true Child of God, yet he prayeth ſtill, remember not the ſins of my youth nor my tranſgreſſions. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>David</hi> was pardoned, (for <hi>Nathan</hi> upon his repentance ſaid unto him, the Lord hath taken away thy ſin, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13.) yet he prayed moſt earneſtly for pardon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>

For ſo it is, there are hardly any of Gods Children, whoſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are not more troubled with the remembrance and remorſe of ſome of their ſins then of others.

                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.</note> St. <hi>James exhorteth and ſtirreth us up unto this,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Confeſſe your ſins one to another, and pray one for another.

It is moſt evident, and manifeſt therefore from hence, that prayer is to be made for the forgivneſſe, not onely of the ſins of thoſe that are unregenerate and unbelievers,</hi> as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed for his perſecutors, ſaying, <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their Charge,</hi>

There is none of us, I preſume, that will ſay that he is holier then Epaphroditus, or that hath more aſſurance of his ſins then he had; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Paul,</hi> as much as he commendeth him, <hi>prayeth heartily for him, that the Lord would ſhew mercy unto him at that day,</hi> the day of judgment, in which he ſhould be preſented, and appeare before Chriſt.

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Another Objection, anſwered.</head>
                  <p>AFter I had thus finiſhed this Queſtion, a friend of mine acquainted me with an argument drawn a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili,</hi> from a ſimilitude, which he heard a Souldier uſe, to prove that he was not to pray for rhe pardon of his ſins: it was this. If one give me a garment, ſhall I ſtill after I have it, petition and pray him to give it me? It were abſurd ſo to do. Seeing therefore God upon my repentance and faith in Chriſt, hath forgiven me my ſins, it will be no leſſe abſurd in me, ſtill to pray for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them. Whereunto I anſwer, that an apt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude doth excellently illuſtrate a matter after it is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but otherwiſe there is little, or no force in it at all of it ſelf to prove any thing that is doubtfull, or called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Queſtion, eſpecially, Si <hi>illo pede claudicat</hi> if it do halt on that foot, wherein the force and ſtrength of the Argument lieth. Now ſo fareth it with this Similitude of his. For that garment he ſpeaketh of, was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely given, and he put into poſſeſſion of it, without being further bound to the performance of any thing for the time to come, unleſſe it were to a duty of thankfulneſſe:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118801:72"/> But our ſins, are not forgiven us abſolutely by God, but upon condition that we do repent and believe in Chriſt, and pray for the pardon of them: yea and this pardon is alſo granted, not to one individuall act of repentance, or of faith, and prayer: but to perſeverance, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in all theſe, as long as we live here, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already. We can have no aſſurance, nor no hope therefore of the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, if we fall away from the faith, revolt to ſin, or leave off praying. Again, a garment is given but once for all, but our ſins, were firſt forgiven <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> from all eternity in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination; Secondly, upon our repentance and faith in Chriſt, they are forgiven in <hi>verbo Evangelii</hi> in Gods word, in his word of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, at Chriſts coming we muſt all appear before his judgment ſeat, to be judged openly before all the world, that the equity of his Juſtice may appear, and be made manifeſt unto all; to the glory of God, the comfort of his Saints, &amp; the confuſion of all the wicked. Untill ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall perſonally appeare before Chriſt, &amp; be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely abſolved by him: we have need ſtill to pray for the pardon of our ſins.</p>

                  <p>Mr. D. ſharply reproveth the practice of this, ſaying. How often have we thought God like unto our ſelves?<note place="margin">Recon: of God to man, page <hi>36.</hi>
                     </note> How many times have we imagined an angry God, a wrathfull Maieſty?

O fooliſh man! if his wrath ſhould not be before appeaſed, what Creatures could ſtand in his ſight? Becauſe of this, he chargeth us to have ſet up an Idol in our hearts throughout the Land. But I would know of him, whether it be not ſafe for Chriſtians, both to ſpeak and pray in the language of the holy Scriptures? Sure I am, <hi>David</hi> prayeth thus.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſten me in thy hot diſpleaſure.</hi> And Pſal. 79.5. <hi>he ſpeaketh and ſaith, How long Lord wilt thou be angry,</hi> for ever? <hi>ſhall thy jealouſly burne like fire?</hi> And then he prayeth, <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen, that have not known thee, and upon the kingdomes that have not called upon thy name.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.3. He alſo ſpeaketh unto God and ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt taken away all thy wrath, thou haſt turned thy ſelf from the fierceneſſe of thine anger.</hi> And then he prayeth and ſaith, <hi>Turn us O God of our ſalvation, and cauſe thine anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us to ceaſe. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</hi> After the like manner, doth <hi>David</hi> ſpeak of Gods anger in divers other <hi>Pſalmes. Moſes</hi> alſo told the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that the Lord was angry, and wroth with him for their ſakes. But,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.2, 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3, 26, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4, 21.</note> not to alledge any more the like ſayings, whereof we meet with many in the holy Scripture; doth not the King of <hi>Ninive,</hi> both ſpeak, and practiſe that, for the averting of Gods heavy judgment from himſelf and his people which Mr. D. greatly condemneth in us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8, 9.</note> the people of this Land? For <hi>he proclaimed a fast and commanded
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118801:73"/> his people to cry mightily unto God, and to turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that was in in his hands,</hi> Saying, <hi>who can tell if God w ll turn, and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi> What? ſhall we ſay, the King of <hi>Nineve</hi> did evill in ſpeaking thus,? No, for this is related here in the prophet, not by way of reproof, but of Commendation, and for our imitation. We are not therefore to find fault with any for faſting and praying, that God would turn away his wrath from them, and from the whole Land, at ſuch times, as this is, for ſo we ſhould hinder, the peoples repentance, and make them profane. But that they may not conceive amiſſe of Gods anger, we are to teach them, that anger is in God, <hi>non per modum affectus, ſed effectus,</hi> that is to ſay, that by the anger of God, we are to underſtand, not any ſuch turbulent paſſion or affection, as is in us, when we are angry. For then God ſhould not be immutable and unchangable. For ſuch paſſions do work a great change and alteration,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 36. <hi>Jam.</hi> 17.</note> both in the body, and in the mind and ſoul of man. Again, if God ſhould be moved, and diſturbed as we are, when we are angry, then he ſhould not be perfectly bleſſed, becauſe he would for that time, or at that preſent want inward quietneſſe, and contentment of mind. By the anger of God therefore, we are to underſtand ſuch effects of Gods juſtice, or ſuch actions as anger produceth in us. Now theſe are reduced by <hi>Zanchius,</hi> and after him by <hi>Polanus;</hi> unto theſe three heads. Firſt all men when they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> angry, do decree and reſolve with themſelves, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on thoſe that wrong them, and puniſh them: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, do threaten them in words; And laſtly, do indeed performe that which they have threatned. So by Gods anger, are meant theſe three things, firſt, his moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> juſt will and decree to viſit and puniſh ſinners, temporally and eternally.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.</note> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſſe,</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Zanchius,</hi> by effects it is manifeſt, what the will of God, that dwelleth in heaven, is againſt all iniquity.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118801:73"/> Secondly by Gods anger is alſo meant his terrifying and threatening of ſinners, &amp; denouncing of judgments againſt them, whether it be by his word, or by portentuous, or prodigious ſignes and tokens. In this ſenſe doth the King of <hi>Nineve</hi> ſpeake, when he ſaith, <hi>Who knoweth if God will turn, &amp; repent, &amp; turn a way from his fierce anger</hi> that is, <hi>ab executione ſuarum Comminationum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> from executing of that fearfull deſtruction on them, which by his prophet he had denounced and threatened. Laſtly, by Gods anger are meant alſo the judgments, and puniſhments themſelves, which he inflicteth on ſinners, in which ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>Thou treaſurest up for thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, id eſt</hi> (ſaith Zanchius) <hi>poenas in illud tempus, quote Deus puniet,</hi> that is, puniſhments, againſt that time, in which God will puniſh thee. And in the ſame ſenſe and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is the anger, or wrath of God to be underſtood, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.23. as <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>To lay down this matter, yet more fully. By Gods anger, we are ſomtimes to underſtand the ſeverity of his juſtice upon obſtinate ſinners, whom he puniſheth without ſhewing them any mercy. <hi>Thus</hi> David <hi>ſpeaketh of Gods anger,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,</hi> that is, according to the rigour of thy juſtice:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.1.</note> unleſſe we ſhall ſay as <hi>Zanchius</hi> and <hi>Polanus</hi> do, that he prayeth that God would not execute the threatenings of his word upon him. So alſo, whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will not execute the fiercenes of mine anger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim.</hi> By the fierceneſſe of Gods anger here, we may either underſtand the ſeverity of his revenging juſtice, or his heavieſt judgments, or elſe thoſe terrible threatenings, which he had denounced againſt the ten Tribes, for their Idolatry, and other ſins. And in the ſame ſenſe he ſpeaketh, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.11. <hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118801:74"/>
                  <p>Again by the anger of God in other places of the Scripture, we are to underſtand the effects of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging juſtice, on the wicked, and of his correcting juſtice on his own Children, both denounced in his word, and executed in his puniſhments and corrections. Thus when <hi>Moſes</hi> told the <hi>Iſraelites, that the Lord was angry with him for their ſakes,</hi> he ſpake this, becauſe the Lord had reproved him for the words which he by their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſpake haſtily, at the waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> and told him that he ſhould not enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And when the Lord ſaith, <hi>that he ſware unto the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Iſraelites <hi>in his wrath, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt;</hi> by his wrath here, is meant that deſtruction, which he had denounced againſt them. Now by the anger of God in other places, are meant the effects both of Gods revenging juſtice executed on the wicked, and of his correcting juſtice on his own Children. An example of the former, we have in the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>wrath is come on them to the utmoſt,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16 <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8.</note> 
                     <hi>extremity of puniſhment.</hi> And of the latter in the believing <hi>Jews. In a little wrath I hide my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſſe I will have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy redeemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I briefly ſhewed, what the Proteſtants do hold, and what they do teach, concerning the anger of God, againſt which I preſume Mr. D. will not reply. No cauſe hath he therefore, to find fault with us, for praying that God would be mercifull unto us, and turn away his wrath and indignation from us, and from the whole Land; unleſſe he will ſay, that it is not lawful for us to ſpeake Tropically, or Figuratively in our prayers, as the Scripture doth.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> How Gods wrath is Pacified.</head>
                  <p>THe next thing which I am to clear, is how God can be ſaid to be pacified, and appealed by faſting, and prayer. For Chriſt onely hath pacified his Fathers wrath, by that propitiatory ſacrifice of his, which he offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for the ſins of all the elect. If any therefore ſhall take upon them by their prayers, or by their faſting and teares to turn away Gods wrath from themſelves, or from the Land, inſtead of pacifying him, they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him ſo much the more, by robbing Chriſt of the glory, that is due unto him. This is another thing (as I conceive,) which Mr. D. in thoſe words of his, which I alledged at the beginning of this Queſtion, doth intend to charge us with. But hereunto I anſwer briefly, that Gods wrath may be ſaid, to be appeaſed two manner of wayes, 1. <hi>Stricté et proprié,</hi> in a more ſtrict and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, by ſatisfaction made to his juſtice, <label type="milestone">

We do willingly therefore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that both the Papiſts, and all other that do think to ſatisfie God for their ſins, and ſo to pacifie his wrath, by their prayers, faſting, and weeping, and afflicting of themſelves, with any ſuch p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus is God, through Chriſt, pacified towards ſinners, when they repent and turn unto him, and pray, and humble themſelves before him according to his gratious promiſes, which he hath made unto them, <hi>Therefore alſo,</hi> now ſaith <hi>the Lord, turn ye even to me, with all your heart, and with faſting,</hi>

For the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and juſtification of which interpretation, I referr my reader to a large, and moſt learned diſſertation of Mr. <hi>Gatakers,</hi> upon this very place of holy Scripture, which I ſaw not, untill I had finiſhed this Queſtion.</p>

Hereunto I add further, that the holy Scripture ſpeaketh ſometimes of the Church of Chriſt, not only as ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be purified from ſin here in this life, but as holineſſe ſhall be perfected in her in the world to come, at what time ſhee ſhall be all fair, not only by juſtification, but internal ſanctification al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſo that no ſpot of ſin ſhall at all adhere unto her.

                  <p>The next thing which I find alledged to prove that the Children of God are not to faſt, nor pray, that God would turn away his indignation from them, are certain places of Scripture, which ſay expreſly that God is never angry with is people, Iſa. 27. <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi>

Of the former, the Lord ſpeaketh to his Church, when he ſaith, <hi>Fury is not in me, and I will be no more wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee,</hi> that is, in wrathfull revenge, to ſatisfie my juſtice on thee.

                  <hi>Queſt. 11.</hi> Whether God do correct his Children for their ſins.</head>
               <p>This Queſtion I thought good to add unto the former, becauſe it is of great affinity with it, and the rather indeed have I done this, becauſe an Acquaintance of mine did lately, long after I had finiſhed this Treatiſe, take upon him to maintaine, that God doth never correct his Children for any ſin, that is committed by them; againſt whom I reaſoned thus. God doth either correct his Children for ſin; or for righteouſneſſe, for there is no mean betwixt theſe two. For our actions, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered ſimply as they are <hi>per ſe et ſua natura,</hi> in themſelves, and in their own nature, are many of them indifferent, that is neither good nor evil morally: yet in <hi>actu exercito,</hi> that is, being clothed with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118801:77"/> as they are when they are practiſed by us, ſo they are all either good or evil. Now, ſaid I, God doth not correct any for righteouſneſſe, or well doing; therefore it is for their ſins and for their evil doings that he correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Children. But hereunto he anſwered, that it is for righteouſneſſe that God correcteth his Children, for ſaid he, God correcteth them from their ſins, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to live righteouſly. I perceived his meaning was, as if he ſhould have ſaid, God correcteth his Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for righteouſneſſe, not that righteouſneſſe which they have done, but which he would have them to do. Now this I willingly yeelded unto him, that the <hi>terminus á quo</hi> of Gods corrections, or rather of our ſanctification which he worketh in us by his corrections, is ſin; and the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> is righteouſneſſe, that is, to ſpeak popularly and plainely, God by his chaſtiſments driveth us from ſin unto righteouſneſſe. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous,</hi>

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.</note> 
                  <hi>but grievous, nevertheleſſe afterwards it yeeldeth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruit of righteouſneſſe, unto them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Thus the end of our Heavenly Fathers Chaſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is to make us to leave our ſins, and to follow after righteouſneſſe. But doth it follow hereupon that we are not corrected for our ſins, whereby we do provoke God, and make him to afflict us? If we ſhould never be overtaken, nor be at all defiled with any ſin, he would never correct us. We may truely therefore be ſaid to be corrected for our ſins, becauſe ſins are they that do pull down Gods corrections upon us. But here mine adverſary replyed and ſaid, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> now all this Chriſt hath born. For as <hi>I ſay,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was wounded for our transgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi>

                  <hi>the Chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes are we healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath

               <p>After I had anſwered theſe Objections, I proceeded and proved unto him that God correcteth his Children for their ſins. The arguments which I then uſed, I ſhall now ſomewhat inlarge, not tying my ſelf ſtrictly to the order in which they were propounded unto him. Firſt of all then, I ſay, that the holy Scripture in expreſſe words affirmeth that God correcteth his Children for their ſins, for thus ſpeaketh the holy prophet <hi>David</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,<note place="margin">This Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of all men, of all times.</note> Pſal. 39.11. <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for iniquity: thou makeſt his beauty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume away like a moath.</hi> And preſently he addeth, <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every man is vanity,</hi> in regard, he meaneth, of Gods corrections, which do weaken and waſte him. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth none out of this number; not the Children of God, more then others. For it were his own afflictions that made him to utter theſe words. For having ſaid, I am conſumed by the blow of thine hand, preſently he inferreth. <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt chaſten man, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away.</hi> David alſo bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Almighty God ſpeaking thus of his poſterity, whereof it cannot be denyed, but many were Gods Children, <hi>If his Children forſake my law, and walke not in my judgments: If they breake my ſtatutes, and keep not my Commandements: then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rodde, and their iniquity with ſtripes, Pſal.</hi> 89.30.31.32. Now what is this, but to correct them for their ſins? And I pray you, did not <hi>Joſephs</hi> bretheren, when they ſuſpected that they were brought into great hazard and danger of their lives in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this was Gods puniſhment or correction on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118801:78"/> them for their ſins? for thus they ſpake one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he ſought us, and we would not heare: therefore (they mean for their ſin in oppreſſing and betraying their Brother,) is the diſtreſs come upon us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. When <hi>Job</hi> alſo ſaith, Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me poſſeſs the ſins of my youth, what meaneth he, but that God laid his hand heavy upon him, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him for the ſins of his youth?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides theſe and many other teſtimonies that might be produced, I reaſon thus, If the ſins of Gods children be the cauſe of their corrections, then they are corrected for their ſins; for what is it to correct one for his ſins, or for his faults; but to correct him, becauſe of ſuch faults and offences, as are committed by him. Now the holy Scripture teſtifieth, that Gods children are corrected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſins which they have committed, and not onely to keep them from ſin <hi>pro futuro,</hi> for the time to come: therefore it cannot juſtly be denyed, that God correcteth them for their ſins. That their ſins are the cauſe of Gods corrections, theſe places of holy Scripture do evidence: firſt, the Lord ſpeaketh to <hi>David</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> and ſaith, The Sword ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thine Houſe, becauſe thou haſt deſpiſed me, and haſt taken the Wife of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.20.</note> the <hi>Hittite</hi> to be thy Wife, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 10. And afterwards he ſaith, Becauſe by this deed (by the murther of <hi>Uriah</hi>) thou haſt given great occaſion, to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the child alſo that is born unto thee, ſhall ſurely die, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. That the death of <hi>Davids</hi> child was a correction to him, it cannot be denyed. Now the cauſe of this correction is here ſaid to be his evil deed, or his ſin which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it followeth neceſſarily therefore, that God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth him for his ſins, his ſins paſt; and not from ſin onely, that he might live righteouſly for the time to come; for the end of <hi>Davids</hi> corrections was not onely his own humiliation and reformation, and the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others from the like ſins, through the terror of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118801:79"/> Gods judgements inflicted on him, but the vindication of Gods glory in the execution of juſtice, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his hatred againſt thoſe ſins of <hi>David,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had made the enemies of God to blaſpheme his holy name. Theſe corrections of <hi>David,</hi> as alſo the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of all Gods children, <hi>ſunt actus juſtitiae Divinae cum miſericordia temperatae,</hi> are acts of Gods juſtice, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with mercy; for God, ſeeing he will not ſpare, no not his deareſt children, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> was, but ſharply chaſtizeth them, hereby he openly declareth, that he is a juſt God, that will not wink at ſin in any, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this his juſtice is tempered with ſingular mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Elect, becauſe their afflictions are through <hi>Gods</hi> grace and goodneſs ſanctified unto them, and do turn to the furtherance of their ſalvation. That one end of <hi>Gods</hi> correcting of his children, is the manifeſtation of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and hatred againſt ſin, <hi>David</hi> himſelf acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his own particular, when he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51, 4. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight, that thou mighteſt be juſtified, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be juſt, when thou ſpeakeſt (againſt me, and reproveſt me) and be clear, that is, appear pure and clear from all fault, when thou judgeſt me by thy pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and corrections. <hi>David</hi> alſo, when Gods hand did lie heavy upon him by ſore ſickneſs, did acknowledge that his ſin was the cauſe of all this; for thus doth he complain unto God,<note place="margin">

But I ſhall not need to alledge any more teſtimonies to prove that <hi>David</hi> was corrected for his ſins. For thoſe whoſe opinion I do now oppugne do grant that God did chaſtize <hi>David</hi> for his ſins; but they ſay, that <hi>David</hi> in theſe his ſufferings, was a type of Chriſt. They hold therefore, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that that which is teſtified concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cauſe of his ſufferings, is not to be applyed to all Gods Children generally, as if they alſo when they are afflicted, ſhould be ſaid to be corrected by their heavenly Father for their ſins. But this that they ſay is no ſolid
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118801:79"/> anſwer, but a meere evaſion. For firſt, Though <hi>David</hi> were a type of Chriſt in his ſufferings, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> as he was unjuſtly perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> falſly ſlandered by <hi>Doeg</hi> and <hi>Sauls</hi> Courtiers, and perfidiouſly and trayterouſly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by <hi>Achitophel</hi> and others, whereof he complaineth in divers of his Pſalms, which the <hi>Evangelists</hi> do alledge, as fulfilled in Chriſt. Yet, it is not enough barely to ſay, but it would be as ſolidly proved, that he was alſo a type of Chriſt in all thoſe evils, wherewith God viſited him for his ſins, in numbering the people, and for the wrongs which he did to <hi>Uriah.</hi> What ſhall we ſay, that whereas <hi>Davids</hi> Wives were defiled before all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the ſight of the Sun, that this befel him onely as he was a Type of Chriſt? and not rather as a correction for his ſin, in defiling <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> Wife? To hold therefore, as theſe men do, that <hi>David</hi> ſuffered onely <hi>propter rationem typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> that is, that he might typifie Chriſts ſufferings, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrange unto me; for ſeeing he was one of Gods Children, no doubt the Lord diſciplined him, as he doth the reſt of his Children; For what Sonne is he, whom the Father chaſteneth not? ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>David</hi> therefore was chaſtized for his ſins, not onely as he was a type of Chriſt, (as theſe men will have it) but as the reſt of Gods Children are, for his humiliation, and future reformation and repentance: as alſo that God by ſcourging him, might manifeſt and make known his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of thoſe ſins, which he had run into, and warn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to beware of them, as I have before ſhewed. But if I ſhall grant that all <hi>Davids</hi> afflictions befel him as he was a type of Chriſt, what will theſe men ſay to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of <hi>Aſa,</hi> the King of <hi>Juda,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16, 7, 8, 9. and of <hi>Miriam</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for both theſe were chaſtened of God for their ſins, <hi>Aſa,</hi> becauſe he truſted not in the Lord, but relyed on the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> for help againſt his enemies; and <hi>Miriam,</hi> becauſe ſhe murmured againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> Will they ſay, that both theſe were in this a type of Chriſt? Indeed I do willingly grant, that <hi>Aſa</hi> was a type of Chriſt, as he was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118801:80"/> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> But that otherwiſe, as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for want of confidence in God, and <hi>Miriam</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ſuffering for her murmuring, ſhould be a type of Chriſt, ſeemeth as yet ſomewhat ſtrange unto me, until I ſhall by theſe men be better inſtructed. And although I do grant, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a type of Chriſt, as he did in ſome ſort perform the Office of a Mediator, between God and the people, yet (I think) it cannot be ſaid, that whereas he was excluded out of <hi>Canaan</hi> for his ſin, that he committed at the waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> that he was in this a type of Chriſt, ſaving us by his ſufferings; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhadowed out the Law, which bringeth none to Heaven. In which regard <hi>Joſhua</hi> that brought the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not <hi>Moſes,</hi> who for his ſin dyed in the Wilderneſs, was a type of Chriſt. But whatſoever is to be ſaid of <hi>Miriam, Aſa, Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> I know they will not affirm, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that came irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently unto the Lords Supper, without due examination, and preparation of themſelves, were any type of Chriſt. Notwithſtanding, St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, That for this cauſe many of them were weak and ſickly, and many of them did ſleep, that is, the ſleep of death. It cannot be denyed therefore, that theſe were ſcourged &amp; corrected for their ſins. This is ſo evident, that they are inforced to grant it, but they think to put it off thus.</p>

The former of theſe might think thus with themſelves, ſeeing this our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs is a judgement of God upon us, what hope can we have in him? And the latter might ſay, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath taken away our friends in judgement, alas, what is become of their ſouls?

               <p>Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> includeth himſelf in the number of thoſe that are thus judged. For he ſaith not, that thoſe men onely that came irreverently to the Lords Table

                  </label> Now what? Can they by their ſins be ſaid to deſerve good, and not rather evil?</p>
               <p>For anſwer hereunto I ſay, that although the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Gods</hi> children are good unto them in their end and iſſue, whereunto they are ſanctified and directed by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118801:81"/> 
                  <hi>God.</hi> In which regard, <hi>Gods</hi> Children do ſay with <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding, as the Apoſtle ſaith, and as we feel in our own experience, our afflictions in themſelves are grievous, and bitter to the fleſh. And therefore as it is ſaid of him that cannot rule his appetite, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to fall into the hands of the Phyſitian, who by bitter Pills, or potions purgeth away the ill-humors, which his delicious Cups, and ſweet morſels bred in his body. So when <hi>Gods</hi> children do ſatisfie their carnal luſts, and ſurfet upon ſin, they deſerve the bitter pills of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which when the heavenly Phyſitian of their ſouls ſhall adminiſter unto them, they have cauſe with <hi>Job,</hi> not only to be patient, and contented but thankfully to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves unto his corrections, and to ſay,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and not receive evil?</hi> Ye ſee then, that the afflictions of <hi>Gods</hi> Children are evil in themſelves, though good in their end.</p>
               <p>The force of this reaſon, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> our adverſaries do think to avoid, by ſaying, that a Father is indeed angry with his children when they offend him, and correcteth them for their faults.</p>
               <p>But ſo doth not God to his children, for he is never angry with any of them, becauſe Chriſt hath born all their ſins, and pacified his Fathers wrath for ever.</p>
               <p>This Objection I ſhall not need here to anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> for I have removed it in the former Queſtion, where I ſhewed that Chriſt hath freed us from Gods revenging wrath, which would have overwhelmed us in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction everlaſting; but not from his paternal indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which tendeth to the furtherance of our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſalvation. And therefore it would not be for our good, but to our hurt, if he ſhould not thus cauſe us to feel his anger, when we forget our ſelves, and go a ſtray from him. I would know alſo, wherefore God calleth himſelf our Father, and us his children? but becauſe he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118801:82"/> dealeth with us, as a Father doth with his children, as in other reſpects, ſo particularly in nurturing us for our ſins, when we offend him by them, as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſheweth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>This that I have ſaid, cannot but be of ſingular uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of God, when they are viſited with his corrections. For if they believe that their ſins are (at leaſt wiſe in part) a cauſe of their afflictions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This will make them ſo much the more diligently to ſearch and examine themſelves, that they may both find out their ſins, and purge them out by repentance, ſaying with the <hi>Jews,</hi>

               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, As he in the time of the Law, that was purſued for murther, which he had unwittingly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly committed, did flie hard to the Alter, or to the City of refuge to ſave his life: ſo when a man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that it are his ſins, that do cauſe God to perſue him with his judgements, it will make him to flie the faſter unto, and to lay the firmer hold on Jeſus Chriſt, that he may obtain forgiveneſs, and ſalvation by him. But when men do deny that their ſins are any cauſe of Gods corrections, then when they lie under his judgements, they will neither ſearch out their ſins, nor humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God for them, nor pray ſo much the more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118801:82"/> earneſtly for the pardon of them, nor repent and turn unto <hi>God</hi> from them.

And hereupon it is, that the true Chriſtian in believing repenteth, and repenting believeth. Thus Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are twiſted together, as it were, and indeed are never ſeparated, as he himſelf acknowledgeth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth neceſſarily alſo, that a man may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his ſalvation, by his repentance. And this he dareth not deny, but ſaith, that it is a ſure mark of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatſoever faileth.</p>
                  <p>But he hath no ſooner granted this, but in the next words he laboureth to rob and bereave Chriſtians of all the comfort, which their Repentance will afford them; for he ſaith, That a man cannot know his Repentance to be true, neither by his hearty ſorrow for his ſins paſt, nor by his ſteadfaſt purpoſe to forſake all ſin, and to walk in all godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He ſaith, that Reprobates, as <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 27.1. and <hi>Judas, Math.</hi> 27.3. repented, and ſorrowed heartily for their ſins. And (ſaith he) doubtleſs all that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, do heartily ſorrow for their ſins, as they that are ſwallowed up with over much ſorrow. But I anſwered him, that ſuch do ſorrow heartily in deed, but nor for their ſins; but for the puniſhment and damnation of them, which they are afraid of. The Apoſtle therefore calleth this <hi>Worldly Sorrow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</note> and ſaith, that it cauſeth death: but in the next words he telleth us, <hi>that godly ſorrow</hi> (which is when a man after a godly manner is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſin, becauſe it is ſin, or becauſe it is an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and a diſhonour to him) worketh repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto ſalvation,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</note> never to be repented of. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore findeth ſuch godly ſorrow in himſelf, may thereby be aſſured of ſalvation. The like is to be ſaid of him that purpoſeth, not by fits and flaſhes; but ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to forſake all ſin, and to walk in all godlineſs. For
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118801:83"/> ſeeing the heart, that is, the will, <hi>tanquam Regina,</hi> as a Queen, commandeth all the inferior faculties of the ſoul, and members of the body; It is certain therefore, that if a man be not diverted from his purpoſe,<note n="*" place="margin">If he be constant in his purpoſe, I ſay, for many times ſenſual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do rebel againſt the will, and do lead it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captive with them.

                  <p>Now how many can he find in this Kingdom, that with <hi>Zacheus</hi> do give half their goods to the poor, or that having Lands and poſſeſſions, do with thoſe primitive Chriſtians ſell them, and lay down at their Miniſters,<note place="margin">

Now what, ſhall we exclude all the reſt from the ſtate of grace, and conſequently, from all hope of ſalvation? I dare not do ſo; and yet I muſt needs ſay, ſeeing the faith that is available to ſalvation, worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. the great want of love, in many forward profeſſors of the Goſpel, may give them juſt cauſe to doubt of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">

For God diſtributeth his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diverſly, to ſome he giveth very large hearts, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them up to do more, then others can ordinarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto, who have received an inferior portion of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.</note> or gift of grace. And hereupon it is, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth, As every man hath received the gift, ſo mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold grace of God.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be liberal in their contributions to the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> doth not call upon them to give half, or any certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate part of their goods unto them, although they were in great neceſſity; but (ſaith he) Every man as he purpoſeth in his heart, ſo let him give, not grudgingly, or of neceſſity,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note> for God loveth a chearful giver. There are ſometimes more, &amp; ſometimes fewer poor to be relieved by us, and ſometimes their neceſſity is greater, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe. Now according hereunto, are we to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our giving of Alms, as the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> do teach very well, unto whom I refer Mr. <hi>D.</hi> for the rectifying of his judgement; only this I will ſay, that unleſs it be in caſe of extream neceſſity, when the poor cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be maintained, but will periſh for want of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

So if a Thief did ſteal out of a mans houſe, money, or Stuffe, and was found, and was convicted thereof, he was to pay double: But in ſome other caſes, the Law required leſſe ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Zacheus</hi> abundant piety therefore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.</note> that moved him to reſtore four fold, either becauſe (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the repenting <hi>Corinthians</hi>) he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on himſelf,<note place="margin">

                  <p>All therefore that have defrauded, oppreſſed, or wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others, are not bound to imitate <hi>Zacheus</hi> in this. For the moral Law, or the Law of nature, which only now under the Goſpel, doth bind all men, of all Nations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth only reſtitution of that which is unjuſtly taken from others; either in the ſame identical thing, if it be not waſted or impaired in the value and worth of it: or if it be either become worſe then it was, when it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, or be loſt, or ſold, or otherwiſe alienated, then it is to be reſtored in the equivalent, or full worth of it. And if the owner thereof ſuſtained any dammage, or loſſe through the want of it, ſince the time that it was taken from him, full ſatisfaction is to be made him for that alſo, that ſo he may be made whole again, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto as good a ſtate and condition, as he would have been in, had he never been robbed, oppreſſed, or defrauded. <hi>Juſtitiae eſt ſuum cuique reddere,</hi> it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of juſtice, to render to every man his own. The Law of nature therefore binds thoſe that have wronged others, to ſuch ſatisfaction as I have ſpoken of. For they cannot be ſayd to have their own rendred unto them, unleſs they receive both the thing that was unjuſtly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and the profit which would have ariſen from it; (the charges deducted in managing, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of it) or if they could, or would have turned it to no profit, had it never been taken, nor withheld from them, yet ſatisfaction is to be made them, <hi>pro damno e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergente,</hi> for the loſſe which they have ſuſtained through the want of it, if any ſuch hath befallen them. If ſuch reſtitution be not made <hi>paenitentia non agitur, ſed fingitur,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, a mans repentance is not true, but counterfeit. For how can a man be ſaid to repent and forſake ſin, as long as he keepeth that wherein he hath ſinned, by him. This Doctrine is delivered by Divines generally, as a certain truth grounded on the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.7</note> and on the written word of God. But I have ſcarce
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118801:86"/> met with any to my remembrance, excepting Mr. <hi>D:</hi> that doth but ſo much as intimate, or inſinuate a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a four fold Reſtitution. For it was not the moral, but the political, or judicial Law, that required of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in ſome caſes a fourfold, in ſome other a five fold, or two fold Reſtitution. And as the learned do well note, this was exacted, and preſcribed, <hi>non per modum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactionis,</hi> not by way of ſatisfaction, which would have been ſufficiently made in the equivalent, (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>ſed per modum paenae,</hi> but by way of puniſhment, to terrifie and reſtrain men from ſuch wickedneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. For which cauſe it was, that the puniſhment was aggravated, where the theft tended greatly to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and dammage of the Common-wealth. For; for this very cauſe it was, that he who ſtole an Oxe, was to reſtore five fold; but he that ſtole a Sheep, but four fold, to wit, becauſe the decay of Oxen, would have been a greater diſcommodity to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> then of their Sheep: for they were forbidden to multiply Horſes; we read therefore, little mention made of them: but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, of their Oxen, Kine, Aſſes and Sheep. If their Oxen therefore ſhould have been taken from them, the tillage of their ground muſt have failed, to ſay nothing that their Oxen alſo did draw their carriages, and tread out their Corn, which Sheep could not do. For this Reaſon alſo it is, that if the Oxe, or the Sheep that were ſtollen, were found alive with the Thief, he was to reſtore but two fold, becauſe they might ſtill be preſerved, and kept alive for the benefit of the Common-wealth.</p>

                  <p>BUt to leave this, I would know of him, when he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt freely to all, without any conditions, If he ſee many that live ſtill in ſin, without any repentance, or reformation of life, hereby imbolden themſelves to rely on Chriſt for ſalvation, whether he will not tell them, that this their Faith is nothing elſe, but carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, or preſumption, which is a more dangerous Rock, then that of deſperation, which he chargeth us by our Doctrine to drive men upon:<note place="margin">Recon. of God to man, <hi>Pag. 64.</hi>
                     </note> though falſely. For as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, in ſeveral places of his Homilies, <hi>plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res pereunt ſperando, quam deſperando,</hi> more do periſh by preſumption, then by deſperation. And here I will tell him, what both I my ſelf, and ſome others heard one ſpeak, with great rejoycing, whoſe converſation was none of the beſt. We never had the Goſpel preached until now, Chriſt is freely offered unto all, nothing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, free Grace is preached. What will you ſay to thoſe, who hearing you preach thus, do turn the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs, and ſay, That they know they ſhall be ſaved by their Faith in Chriſt, who is freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, without any conditions? what you and thoſe, who preach thus, will ſay, I know not; but ſure I am, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to them, and to all, Prove your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the Faith. And then he ſheweth how this is to be done.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note> Know you not your own ſelves, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates? As if he ſhould ſay, Whoſoever they are that believe in Chriſt, they have him dwelling in them by his Spirit: hereby therefore ſhall you know, that ye are true believers, even by his ſpirit, whereof ye are made partakers. For as St.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118801:87"/> 
                     <hi>John</hi> alſo ſaith, Hereby we know, that he abideth in us,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24.</note> by the Spirit that he hath given us. He therefore, that upon good proof, and experience, findeth that the Spirit of God is in him, mortifying his carnal luſts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and renewing him in holineſs, may be aſſured hereby, that he is by Faith ingrafted into Chriſt, and that he ſhall be ſaved by him. For it is not fleſh and blood that worketh ſuch an inward and univerſal change in us, but the ſpirit of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. And of this St. <hi>Iohn</hi> aſſureth us, when he ſaith, This is our Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that overcommeth the World even our Faith. As if he ſhould ſay, it is our Faith in Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4.</note> (whereby we are made pertakers of the ſpirit of God, which he merited for us, who believe in him) that makes us Conquerors of the World, that is of thoſe ſinful luſts, that raign in worldly men, and not any power or ſtrength of our own. Where ſin therefore is thus conquered, there is true faith; but in whomſoever ſin ſtill raigneth, 'tis in vain for him to boaſt of his faith, or of the free grace of God; for as yet he can lay no claim thereto. Thus Mr. <hi>D.</hi> I have proved, that our love to the Brethren, and other effects of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which are never ſeperated from true Faith, do bear witneſs to our Faith, and teſtifie the truth of it, not only before men,<note place="margin">Confer. with a ſick man. Pag. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> (as you ſay) but inwardly alſo to our ſouls and conſciences, which you muſt not deny, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what you have written, concerning the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of Man to God. <hi>pag.</hi> 57, 59, 60. for there you ſay, that joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and the love of God, and of our Brethren, and new obedience, are inſeperable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to our reconciliation by Faith. Every one of theſe therefore muſt needs aſſure us of our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, unleſs you will ſay, that a man may know that he hath faith, but cannot know, either that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in God, or that he loveth God and his Children, or that he obeyeth his word and Commandements, of which I can ſee no reaſon, ſeeing faith is as ſpiritual, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and as hard to be known, as any of theſe. For my part, I cannot conceive, how the ſouls of thoſe that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118801:88"/> are reconciled unto God, ſhould have ſuch abundant joy, as you ſpeak of, be filled even with floods of comfort, and have no knowledge, nor feeling thereof at all. And though the true love of God cannot alwayes ſo eaſily be ſeen, and diſcerned by every one in whoſe heart it is, as ſuch ſuperabundant joy and rejoycing may: yet if he that loveth God could not know that he doth ſo, our Saviour would not have ſaid unto <hi>Peter,</hi> Loveſt thou me? neither could <hi>Peter</hi> have anſwered, as he did, Yea Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee:<note place="margin">

Now as a true Chriſtian may know that he loveth God, ſo may he alſo that he truly repenteth, and liveth not according to his fleſhly luſts, but according to Gods Commandements, and is therefore his Servant. For elſe how could <hi>Iob</hi> have ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 42.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.6.</note> that he abborred himſelf, and repented in duſt and aſhes? Or how could <hi>David</hi> have ſaid, Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, and the Son of thine Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid? It will be worth the while alſo, to take further notice what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath written concerning the love of God, and the keeping of his Commandements. This Garment of love (ſaith he) is like the Garment of divers colours, wherewithall the Kings Daughters which were Virgins, were apparelled.</p>
                  <p>If a woman be ſeen in the ſtreet, without a party colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Garment, it is concluded, that ſhe is either none of the Kings daughters, or at leaſt no Virgin: ſo is that Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love, I ſay, that thing wherewith all the people of God, reconciled to him, are adorned: if we ſee a ſoul altogether ſtript of this Ornament, we conclude they are not in the number of Gods people, at leaſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. Therefore the Holy Ghoſt concludes, He that loveth not, knoweth not God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.8. And as on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative he pronounceth, Grace be on all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24. So alſo on the negative, If any love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. Now with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118801:88"/> the love of God is joyned the keeping of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, as an inſeparable effect thereof. This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. If ye love me, keep my Commandements. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 14, 15. If a man love me, he will keep my words, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. Chriſt entering into the ſoul, ſhall drive out whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is prophane, and draw up the ſoul by the cords of love, unto new obedience. And to this place we refer hatred of ſin, love of vertue, a godly ſorrow for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion committed, revenge upon our ſelves, for the things that are paſt, and a jealous care for that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>D.</hi> From all which, I pray you, may not I infer and conclude, both negatively, that he who liveth in ſin and loveth the World, and the things thereof, is deſtitute of the true love of God, and as yet, can have no aſſurance of ſalvation? and affirmatively, that if a man can find, that he ſincerely and unfainedly loveth God, and teſtifieth the truth hereof, by obedience unto his Commandements, he may hereby, (and not by faith only, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will have it) be aſſured of Gods love, and of his own eternal ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt? Doubtleſs, St. <hi>Peter</hi> would have us thus to conclude,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and reſolve upon it; for he biddeth us make our Calling and Election ſure, by the practice of other vertues, as well as of Faith; and conſequently, giveth us to underſtand, that aſſurance of ſalvation is to be had, not from Faith only, but from charity alſo, and from brotherly love, and all thoſe other Vertues and Graces that are joyned with it; and by the Apoſtle in that place, particularly rehearſed, and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up. For it muſt needs be granted, that thoſe who are aſſured of their election, are thereby alſo aſſured of their ſalvation; ſeeing it is not poſſible, that any of the Elect ſhould periſh, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.24.

And on the other ſide, a mans faith when it is grounded on the promiſes of the Goſpel, that is, when he reſteth and relyeth on Jeſus Chriſt, not only for the pardon of his ſins, but for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſanctification, and endevoreth to obey God in all things, may aſſure him of both theſe, although he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the ſincerity, and truth of ſome of his works, by reaſon of the reliques of the fleſh, or of that carnal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that doth adhere as yet unto them. But the beſt aſſurance of all other is, when a man upon proof and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination findeth that both his faith and works, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before God, that is ſincere and ſound, though ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many infirmities, and imperfections, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. to 12.

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:118801:94"/>6. I do alſo reaſon thus, As the Law is the covenant of works, or at leaſt wiſe, as the covenant of works is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Law: So the goſpel revealeth, and maketh known unto us the covenant of grace, or of ſalvation, by the meer mercy of <hi>God,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt. As the Law therefore binding us to the perfect obedience thereof, if we will be ſaved, and otherwiſe denouncing damnation, if we tranſgreſs it, doth hereby ſhew, wherein the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works conſiſteth. So ſeeing the goſpel doth not offer remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto all, nor unto any abſolutely; but unto thoſe only that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe the Goſpel, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. and obey <hi>Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 5.9. It followeth therefore, that the Goſpel bindeth us to the obedience thereof, as to our part of the covenant of grace: yet ſo, that we are to do the things which the Goſpel requireth, not by our own ſtrength, as the Law injoyneth, <hi>Sed ſubſidio gratiae divinae, à Chriſto pronobis partae;</hi> but by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Gods</hi> grace, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed for us. So that even in this regard, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a covenant of grace, as well as in reſpect of our free juſtification, and eternal ſalvation in Heaven: becauſe our ſalvation, from the beginning unto the end thereof is of grace, and not of nature; or by any power or ſtrength of our own free will. For all the powers of our ſouls are in bondage to ſin and Sathan, until they be freed by <hi>Christ,</hi> as our Saviour himſelf giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, when he ſaith, If the Son ſhall ſet you free, ye ſhall be free indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.26. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. That it is not we our ſelves, by any power of our own; but God of the riches of his grace, who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</p>
                  <p>Thus the very works, or acts of Faith, Repentance, and new obedience which we are bound unto in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are effects of Gods grace in us. We preſume not therefore, to do them by any power of our own, but do covenant the performance of them, by the grace of <hi>God</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, diligently uſing the meanes that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118801:94"/> us in the Goſpel, for the building of us up in grace, and waiting upon God for a bleſſing on them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And laſtly, When the people of God in the old Teſtament, had revolted from him by Idolatry, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foul ſins: We read, that when they repented,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.</note> they bound themſelves by Covenant, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandements, and his teſtimonies, and his Statutes. Now ſhall we ſay, that they renewed the legal covenant. We have no reaſon to think ſo; for they knew it was impoſſible for them to keep it. They covenanted therefore, to keep Gods Commandements evangelically, whereunto they had before bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they were circumciſed; yea, and not only ſo, but were born under this covenant, being deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ancient Patriarchs, with whom and their Seed, the Lord entred into covenant. It was this covenant of the Goſpel; (for ſuch was the covenant which the Lord made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as is to be ſeen, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17, 18.) that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they repented, and returned unto the Lord from Idolatry, renewed with him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things which I have thus alledged, do make it manifeſt, both that the covenant of grace is properly a covenant, and that it is made, not only with Chriſt our head, but with every one of us that are his members, who by this covenant are bound to faith in Chriſt, and new obedience, that ſo we may glorifie God, and be ſaved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, through his rich mercy in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this that I have ſaid, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>But, how he can prove hence, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> that the covenant of grace was made only with Chriſt, and not with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I cannot ſee. The contrary rather may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118801:95"/> and deduced from theſe words; for the Apoſtle ſaith, That the promiſes were made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, which is Chriſt. To Chriſt indeed only, as to the Mediator, in whom the covenant is confirmed of God, as the Apoſtle explaineth himſelf in the next words: but, otherwiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful; and conſequently, to all that tread in his ſteps, as to thoſe to whom forgiveneſs of ſins, and the other benefits and bleſſings purchaſed by Chriſt, and promiſed in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, do appertain and belong.</p>
                  <p>This will be the more manifeſt, and evident unto us, if we do conſider, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. The words indeed are difficult, and therefore diverſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the learned.</p>
                  <p>The moſt common expoſition is, that by the promiſes are meant, that promiſe of the Lord to <hi>Abraham, In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> And that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>numero plurali,</hi> in the plural number; becauſe this promiſe was at ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and made unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now it is evident, that the ſeed here ſpoken of, is Chriſt; for in him only it is, that all the Nations of the Earth are bleſſed. But it doth not hereupon follow, that the covenant is made only with him. For from theſe very words, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer againſt Mr. S. that all Chriſts members are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the covenant, as well as he, though after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, and in another ſort. For the promiſe is made unto Chriſt only, that he ſhall be the Authour of bleſſedneſs unto all Nations; but unto them, that they ſhall be bleſſed in him. Now I would know how all Nations ſhall be bleſſed in Chriſt? verily not ſo, as if no one perſon of any Nation were to be excluded; for then all the World ſhould be ſaved, and none ſhould be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>The meaning therefore of this gracious promiſe, muſt needs be that all Nations ſhould be bleſſed in Chriſt, not abſolutely; but according to the conditions expreſſed,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118801:95"/> and laid down in the Goſpel, wherein the covenant of grace is fully opened, and unfolded. Or that Elect, who are to be gathered out of all Nations, ſhall be bleſſed in Chriſt, who only fulfil the conditions of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>There is another expoſition of theſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and that is, that by the promiſes of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaketh, we are to underſtand the promiſe which the Lord at ſeveral times made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would give unto him, and to his ſeed, the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, as a type of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance of Heaven, whereof it was an aſſurance unto them. That whereby <hi>Eſtius,</hi> and other learned men, are led and induced to renounce the former expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to imbrace this latter, is, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> without any neceſſity, doth twice repeat this word <hi>[And]</hi> ſaying to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, were the promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to ſeeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy ſeed. For the ſenſe would have been as compleat and full, ſay they, if the word <hi>[And]</hi> had been left out, and he had ſaid, he ſaith not of ſeeds as of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but as of one, to thy ſeed. They think therefore, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath no reference to that promiſe, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> where this word <hi>[And]</hi> is not found; but to theſe words, To thee, and to thy ſeed, will I give the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> unto which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by repeating this word <hi>[And]</hi> there expreſſed, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to relate. But, if we ſhall admit of this Expoſition, it will no way advantage Mr. S.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Piſcator</hi> giveth two Reaſons, why theſe words of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118801:96"/> Apoſtle, [which ſeed is Chriſt] are not to be underſtood properly, to wit, of Chriſts perſon only.</p>
                  <p>Firſt (ſaith he) the Apoſtles ſcope is againſt it, which is to prove, that eternal life is given unto believers, for Chriſts ſake, and that according to the promiſes which he made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as appeareth from the fourteenth Verſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, This abſurdity is againſt it, that eternal life ſhould be given to Chriſt only.</p>
                  <p>I have thus laid down the ſeveral expoſitions of theſe words of the Apoſtle, that it may appear the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that it cannot from hence be collected, that the covenant was made only with Chriſt, and not with his members. For otherwiſe, if I ſhall ſpeak what I think, I am fully perſwaded, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in ſaying, To <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, which is Chriſt, were the promiſes made, hath reference to that gracious evangelical promiſe, in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed. This is the promiſe (or the covenant as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the foregoing words,) which the Lord made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> plainly giveth us to underſtand, in thoſe words of his unto the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25.</note> Ye are the children of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God made with our Fathers, ſaying unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kinreds of the Earth be bleſſed. Where you ſee St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth the word <hi>[And]</hi> even in this promiſe, as it is alſo ſet down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. where the Lord ſpeaketh to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſaith, In bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed. Thus the foundation of the latter Expoſition before ſpoken of, is removed, and falleth to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Now from theſe words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it may alſo be plainly proved againſt Mr. S. that the covenant of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not made only with Chriſt: For wherefore doth he ſay unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Ye are the children of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which God made with the Fathers; but becauſe this covenant belonged unto them, and they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in it.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Chriſt did not repent, and believe for us, but we muſt perform theſe conditions our ſelves.</head>
                  <p>LEt us now ſee, whether Chriſt have fulfilled all the conditions of the covenant of the Goſpel for us: Whether he hath believed, repented, and was mortified, and obeyed the Goſpel for us. We acknowledge with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Law,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4.</note> for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto us, and that we are juſtified before God by his obedience. We acknowledge alſo, that the ſpots of ſin, that adhere to our works of ſanctification, are waſhed away in his blood; and ſo not only our perſons, but our works alſo become acceptable to God, not for any merit, or intrinſical holineſs, or worthineſs of their own; but as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, by Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14.</note> in whoſe blood the Saints of God have waſhed their Robes of righteouſneſs and holineſs, and made them white.</p>
                  <p>All this we do willingly grant; but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould perform for us thoſe very duties of faith and repentance, and mortification, which are required of us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſeemeth to me very ſtrange. For as we are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from fulfilling the Law, to be juſtified thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Christ</hi> hath thus fulfilled it for us; ſo if <hi>Chriſt</hi> have believed and repented for us, will it not follow hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God will not require theſe duties of us, or that he will not condemn us, though we neglect and omit them; no more than he will, becauſe we tranſgreſs his Law, and do not perfectly fulfill it to be thereby juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When the Scripture ſaith that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for us, is not the meaning hereof, that he died <hi>noſtra vice</hi> in our ſtead, and ſo by his death hath redeemed us from death, and damnation everlaſting? ſo when <hi>David</hi> ſaid, Would God I had died for thee, my Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> his meaning was, that he deſired to have died in <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſtead, that he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118801:97"/> might by his own death, have freed <hi>Abſolon</hi> from death. In like manner therefore, if we ſhall ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, repented, and was mortified for us, the meaning hereof will be, that he performed all theſe duties in our ſtead, and ſo hath freed and diſcharged us from them. What other conſtruction theſe words will bear, I know not; but ſure I am, that many are imboldened by them, too much to neglect the practice of repentance, and the duties of ſanctification and holineſs. But not to ſtand any longer upon this, I would know how it can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> either believed, or repented, or was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified for us?</p>
                  <p>For firſt, When Mr. S. ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> believed for us, he ſpeaketh not of the legal faith, or confidence in God (for thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> believed for us, ſeeing for us he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the whole Law; nor of the faith and confidence that Chriſt had in God his Father, that he would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſtrengthen him, to perform the great work of our Redemption; but of juſtifying faith, which is, that whereby we rely on Chriſt, for the pardon of our ſins. Now this juſtifying faith, <hi>eſt in nobis ſubjectivè, non in Chriſto</hi> is in us, as in its proper ſubject, not in Chriſt. And this both the Prophet <hi>Habakuk,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4.</note> and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> do teach us, when they ſay, <hi>Juſtus fide ſuà vivet,</hi> the juſt ſhall live by his own faith, and not by the faith of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.</note>The true believers therefore ſay not, Chriſt hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for us; but we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law. But if it ſhould be granted, that Chriſt believed for us, that we by that faith of his, might be juſtified: how ſhall we ſalve that other ſaying of his? how ſhall we make it good, that Chriſt repented for us? for repentance alwayes preſuppoſeth ſin: it is a turning from ſin, unto righteouſneſs. Such is the repentance, which the Lord in his Goſpel required of us. Now what Chriſtian eares can indure to hear, that Chriſt ſhould be ſaid to have turned from ſin unto righteouſneſs. Chriſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118801:97"/> was never overtaken with any ſin, he never turned from God: therefore he cannot be ſaid to have turned from ſin unto God, as we do when we are converted. Nor can he be ſaid to have been mortified for us; for there was no fleſh, nor none of the old man in him, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any mortification.</p>

                  <p>BUt let us ſee now, how Mr. S. endevoureth to prove and make good, that Chriſt hath fulfilled all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Goſpel for us.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle (ſaith he) teacheth, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that Chriſt is made unto us of God, Sanctification: his holineſs therefore, is ours, he wrought it for us.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</note> Whatſoever holy duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of faith, or new obedience are required of us in the Goſpel, Chriſt hath fulfilled them for us.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have urged, and inforced his Argument to his greateſt advantage, as I ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer whereunto I ſay, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> that Chriſt may be ſaid to be made unto us Sanctification three manner of wayes. 1. <hi>Imputativè,</hi> by way of imputation. 2. <hi>Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> by way of merit. 3. <hi>Effectivè,</hi> efficiently, or effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally working it in us. The firſt of theſe Mr. S. maketh choyce of and pitcheth upon. For he will have Chriſts holy obedience, to be imputed unto us for our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Now I grant, that it is imputed unto us indeed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.</note> but for our juſtification, not for our ſanctification. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, by the obedience of one (that is of Jeſus Chriſt) many are juſtified, or made righteous.</p>
                  <p>Again, If Chriſts holineſs ſhould be imputed unto us, for our ſanctification, then ſanctification ſhould not be inherent in us; but external, and without us, as our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:118801:98"/>
                  <p>And laſtly, Then there ſhould be no real difference between our juſtification and ſanctification, neither ſhould they be different graces, but altogether the ſame. For wherein conſiſteth our juſtification, but in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts holy obedience unto us. Now if our ſanctification do conſiſt in this alſo,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. &amp; 13.12.</note> what real difference will there be between them? I do indeed acknowledge, that the holy Scripture doth now and then make no real difference between ſanctification and juſtification. For whereas the Apoſtle ſaith ordinarily, that we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of Chriſt, it is ſaid, that we are ſanctified by his blood. Where I conceive, that ſanctification, is either put for juſtification, or at the leaſt, that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is included in it, as it muſt needs be, if we ſhall ſay that the meaning of the Apoſtle is, that the blood of Chriſt hath merited both our juſtification and our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this ſenſe I do willingly grant, that Chriſt is made unto us ſanctification, that is, by the merit of his paſſion purchaſing it, and by his blood waſhing away the ſpots of ſin, that do adhere to our ſanctification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And laſtly, I do alſo acknowledge (as all Orthodox Proteſtants do) that Chriſt is our ſanctification, not only <hi>meritorieé,</hi> by way of merit, <hi>ſed effectivé;</hi> but efficiently alſo, becauſe by his ſpirit, which he hath purchaſed of his Father, he doth ſanctifie us, or effect and work holineſs in us. And thus (as I take it) I have cleared the Apoſtles meaning, and made it manifeſt, that he hath no intent to teach, that Chriſt believed for us, and obeyed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for us, in that ſenſe, as Mr. S. taketh his words, when he ſaith, That Chriſt is made unto us of God ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> They were ſinners. Its true, they were ſo; but though the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were then offered unto them, yet they did not then belong to them, nor had they any intereſt in them, until they received them; but as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.</note> They were ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, and ſo ſhould have remained, &amp; continued for ever, had they rejected them, as did the Jewes, and ſome other Citizens of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Briefly therefore I do reaſon thus. Promiſes do belong to thoſe, to whom they are made, and not to any other: but the promiſes of the Goſpel, concerning remiſſion of ſins, and eternal ſalvation in Heaven, are made to thoſe that either do for the preſent, or ſhall hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not to any other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none have any right to theſe promiſes, but ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and repentant ſinners.<note place="margin">
                        <p>Object.</p>

                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be Mr. S. or ſome other, will here reply, and ſay, are the promiſes of the Goſpel then to be offered to none, but to thoſe that do repent and believe?</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:118801:99"/>
                  <p>Yes, They are to be offered unto all, neither Infidels, nor any other ſinners excluded: but not abſolutely, <hi>ſed ſub conditione fidei &amp; reſipiſcentiae;</hi> but upon condition, that they do repent,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 16, 16 <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19.</note> and believe, if they will have their ſins blotted out, and be ſaved through the mercy of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus indeed, <hi>promiſsiones Evangelij ſunt univerſales con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione &amp; promulgatione, ſed non applicatione,</hi> the promiſes of the Goſpel are to be preached, and propounded unto all; but all do not appropriate, and apply them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor intereſt themſelves in them.</p>
                  <p>Now wherefore is this? but as I ſaid before, becauſe the promiſes are not abſolute, but conditional. For were they abſolute, and no condition at all were required, then one man ſhould have as great an intereſt in them, and as good right to them, as another, whether he were belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or unbeliever.</p>

                     </label> But I anſwer, No ſuch thing followeth hereupon. For the Apoſtles words are, That Chriſt is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to wit, then the former covenant was, which God by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> made with the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Now by this former covenant, if he meaneth the covenant of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118801:99"/> grace, as it was adminiſtred unto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by this latter and better cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the ſame covenant of grace, as it is plainly laid down in the Goſpel: the promiſes of this latter covenant are better then thoſe of the former.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are clearly delivered in expreſs and plain words, whereas thoſe were darkly ſhadowed out under types and figures, and dimly repreſented in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Prophecies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe there is a greater meaſure of the ſpirit, and of the graces thereof, both promiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, now under the new Teſtament, ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt in the fleſh, then was formerly in the old Teſtament: This may well be the meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. But if we ſhall ſay, that he doth in theſe words of his compare together, the covenant of works, and the covenant of grace, then I ſay, that the promiſes of the Goſpel are better promiſes, then are the promiſes of the covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe remiſſion of ſins is promiſed in the Goſpel, which is not to be had by the Law. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fulfilleth not all the Commandements thereof,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</note> it ſhutteth him up under the everlaſting wrath, and curſe of God, without any hope of pardon.</p>
                  <p>Again, The promiſes of the Goſpel, are ſaid to be better then thoſe of the Law, becauſe the Goſpel promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth grace, whereby we are inabled to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereof, which the Law doth not. For the Law only forbiddeth ſin, and commandeth that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and juſt, and good, but miniſtreth no power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which it requireth; but in the new covenant of the Goſpel, the Lord promiſeth, that he will write his Lawes in our hearts, and put his ſpirit within us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</note> and cauſe us to keep his Commandements, and to do them. Thus by the grace of God in Chriſt, we are ſtrengthened, and inabled to keep the covenant of the Goſpel: whereas it is altogether impoſſible for us, ſo to keep the Law, as to be juſtified and ſaved thereby.</p>

                  <p>

And if this be not enough, he ſaith afterwards in expreſſe words, that <hi>Jeremy</hi> calleth the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> being conſidered by it ſelf, and in it ſelf, the legal and old Covenant, becauſe it was the covenant of our creation, whereby the Lord required of us perfect obedience, to

                     </note>There were three conditions of the covenant of grace, without which there could have been no peace between God and Man.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was, That ſome one ſhould be a purchaſer or procurer of this peace, that is, a Mediator, who upon a way agreed upon, ſhould make peace between God and man. That way was, that he ſhould proceed, or come forth from God unto mankind, not only as an herald, or as a Meſſenger between them (for he could not come forth from men) declaring Gods will concerning peace; but that he ſhould both pacifie Gods wrath, by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his perſon, merit and interceſſion, and that he ſhould alſo by his divine efficacy, confer upon men grace, righteouſneſs, and life eternal by him obtained for them. The former of theſe was neceſſary, in regard of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and truth: the latter, in regard of mens imbecility. The ſecond condition was, That God for the interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſatisfaction, and merit of the Mediator, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſinners into his grace or favour of enemies, ſhould make them his friends, and Sons, and bleſſe them with eternal joy and happineſs with himſelf. The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118801:101"/> was, that men ſhould acknowledge this comprehenſive grace of God towards them, receive by faith the benefits purchaſed by the Mediator, offered and given in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and be thankful unto God, in all holy obedience. Let every one that readeth theſe things, ſee and conſider, whether it be Proteſtant Doctrine, to teach, that there are on our part no conditions at all in the covenant of grace; but that all the conditions thereof belong unto Chriſt, as Mr. S. will have it.</p>

                     </label> it is further thus objected. If God ſhould exact, or require any thing by way of condition of us, then our ſalvation ſhould not be of grace, but of merit.</p>
                  <p>But no ſuch thing followeth hereupon;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for we are bound to ſerve, and to obey God, both by right of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Redemption. Now what may not God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us, that which is his own? yea, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition alſo of our Faith and Repentance, if we will be partakers of the reward which he freely promiſeth unto our obedience? Methinks this ſhould not be denyed, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing it is for our good, that God doth offer ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto us, upon ſuch conditions; for hereby we are ſtirred up to uſe the means of our ſalvation, the more carefully and diligently, that ſo we may be both for the preſent aſſured, and hereafter pertakers of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, to our endleſs comfort.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:118801:102"/>
                  <p>Again, God in his Goſpel requireth no other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of us, but what we in duty are bound to perform: now what! can we be ſaid to merit any thing by doing of our duty? I trow not; for our Saviour teacheth us, when we have done all that is required of us, yet to ſay, that we are unprofitable Servants, we have but done that which in duty we were bound to do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, God hath elected and choſen us to the means, as well as to the end, for by the meanes we come to the end. And hereupon it is, that the end that is, eternal ſalvation is not promiſed abſolutely, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of the means that lead unto it, that is, of Faith and Repentance, which God of his grace worketh in us, and we by the grace of God are to perform, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are elected unto them, as well as to the end it ſelf, which is our eternal ſalvation by Chriſt. Now that which we thus obtain by the free election of God, and for the merit of Chriſt, and not by any power of our own, but by the work of his grace, it would be too much pride in us, to think that we do any way merit it: by this that hath been ſaid, it appeareth, that the thing which is made over unto us, upon a condition, <hi>non tranſit in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum,</hi> doth not become meritorious upon our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that condition, unleſs it be <hi>res indebita,</hi> a thing to be done by us, whereunto we are not bound; and unleſs alſo there be ſome proportion and equality, between it and the reward: otherwiſe a condition is only a barre to the receiving and injoying of the thing promiſed, until it be fulfilled; or if the condition be not fulfilled at all by us, or in the time appointed, and ſet down, then we looſe the thing promiſed, and deprive our ſelves of it.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman (as I heard ſome few years ſince from a Servant of his) did promiſe to give unto the Vicar, in an impropriate Rectory, that belonged unto him 40 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                     <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> if he would receive it as his free gift, and teſtifie this under his hand.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118801:102"/>
                  <p>Now I demand, whether this requiring of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as a free gift, did turn it into a merit? Doubtleſs, it did not; for unleſs the Vicar would under his hand, acknowledge that he received it as a free gift, he was to forfeit it, and to loſe it, as indeed he did: not becauſe he did think that he ſhould have merited ſome thing, if he had fulfilled this condition; but out of pertinacy and ſtomack, becauſe his predeceſſor had more; or out of the pride of his heart, contemning this gift, as too ſmall and mean, for a man of that worth, which he took himſelf to be.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſame is to be ſaid concerning eternal life, which God offereth unto us, upon condition of our faith and repentance; for the exacting of this condition, doth neither make eternal life, to be any whit the leſſe the free gift of God; nor doth it any whit diminiſh, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our bond of thankfulneſs to God, for this his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and unconceivable bleſsing and benefit.</p>

                  <p>YEt notwithſtanding, Becauſe I would not willingly conceal any part of the truth, I do freely grant, that the promiſes of the Lord, are in ſome ſort abſolute, that is, in reſpect of the grace promiſed by God unto his people, whereby they may be inabled to keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and his Commandements, or in reſpect of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which he hath promiſed them.</p>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord doth promiſe his Spirit unto his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect onely, whereby they are inabled to obey the Goſpel, and to lay hold of ſalvation: yet he doth enter into a conditional covenant with all the viſible members of his Church. For as all that were circumciſed of old were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into covenant with God, not only the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but proſelytes alſo of the Gentiles, and their ſeed: ſo unto all, both Jewes and Gentiles, that do joyn themſelves unto the Church, and are baptized: doth God promiſe and covenant ſalvation upon condition, that they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in Chriſt; and they for their parts, do

Not onely believing Parents therefore themſelves, but their ſeed alſo are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into covenant with God; and hereupon it is, that the Children of believers are called holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. that is, <hi>ſanctitate faederali,</hi> by a federal ſanctity, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby they are dedicated, and conſecrated unto God, (even as the Veſſels of the Temple, and the Prieſts and Levites and Tythes, and all conſecrated things were called holy, not in regard of internal, but external holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being ſet apart for the moſt holy God, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.)

It is manifeſt therefore, that as God did with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, ſo he doth now enter into a conditional covenant with all the viſible members of the Church, that is, with all that make profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt, and of obedience to his Goſpel, and with their ſeed.

                  <p>THus (as I take it) I have ſufficiently corroborated and confirmed my firſt Reaſon, or Argument againſt the exceptions taken, and objections made againſt it by Mr. S. and others. I have made it evident, that there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required of us in the Goſpel: it followeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily from his own words, that the Goſpel in regard of us, as well as of Chriſt, is really and properly a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Now for the concluſion, and ſhutting up of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion and controverſie, I will put Mr. S. in mind of ſome of thoſe abſurdities, which he and all thoſe do thruſt themſelves upon, who deny the Goſpel to be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in regard of us, and affirm it to be nothing elſe, but an abſolute promiſe of ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From hence it will follow, that neither <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> nor any other Apoſtates, no nor any Chriſtians that live diſſolutely, or flagitiouſly, after their Baptiſme, are to be accuſed, or charged with any breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againſt God, no more then Infidels, or Heathens that never heard of Chriſt at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It will alſo as neceſſarily follow from hence, that not only others, but even the primitive and moſt ancient Chriſtians, ever ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, have dealt impiouſly, who received none into their Communion by Baptiſme, but thoſe that firſt renounced the world, the fleſh, and the Devil, and bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a ſolem vow, promiſe or covenant to believe in Chriſt, and to ſerve God, and to walk before him, in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118801:104"/> wayes of his Commandements, all the dayes of their life.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From hence alſo it followeth, that it is not lawful for Chriſtians to enter into covenant with God, becauſe this would be ſuperſtition, and will-worſhip, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no foundation in the Goſpel. And ſo it will follow alſo, that Mr. S. and as many as are of his Opinion, if they have taken the Parliament Covenant, have diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and played the Hypocrites, both with God and Man. For if the Law only be a Covenant in regard of us, and not the Goſpel, then mens binding themſelves to God by covenant, was lawful under the Law; but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel.</p>

And we ſay, that works are neceſſary to our juſtification, at leaſtwiſe, to the continuance of it, after a far inferior manner, that is, <hi>neceſsitate preſentiae, non efficientiae,</hi> as duties neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, and going with it; not as any cauſes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting, or working it. Thus whereas the Law requireth works, as cauſes of our juſtification, and ſalvation, we require Faith, Repentance, and ſuch works or duties, as the Goſpel teacheth, only as neceſſary conditions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot be ſaved. For (as I have proved in the former Queſtion) the Goſpel indeed offereth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all by Chriſt; but not abſolutely, but upon condition of their faith, and repentance. Where faith therefore in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and repentance are wanting, it is in vain for men to believe that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto <hi>God,</hi> or that they are in the ſtate of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the Doctrine now taught by Mr. D, Mr. S. and many others. Whereas theſe men then do think, that all conditions are legal, they are herein deceived. For the difference between the Law and the Goſpel, is not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118801:105"/> that the one requireth conditions to be performed, and the other none at all, which were it ſo, then the Goſpel ſhould be a Doctrine of licentiouſneſs, and carnal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but in this, that the Law offereth ſalvation unto none, but unto thoſe that do perfectly fulfill it, without failing in any the leaſt duty therein required and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; but the Goſpel offereth pardon of all ſins, and tranſgreſſions unto all that believe in Chriſt, and riſe up out of their ſins, by repentance when they are fallen, and do not ſtill lie in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Law is a covenant of works, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth ſalvation to none, but to thoſe that do the works therein preſcribed and commanded;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8.</note> but the Goſpel is a covenant of faith, or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, the word of faith, becauſe it promiſeth forgiveneſs of ſins, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all thoſe that renouncing themſelves, and their own works, do relie only upon Chriſt for ſalvation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſes of his Goſpel.</p>

                  <p>THis that I have already ſaid, might be ſufficient for an anſwer unto this Queſtion: notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many at this day by hearing of our late new Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and reading of their Books, have their mindes and underſtandings ſo vitiated, and depraved, that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they hear us teach the neceſſity of repentance unto ſalvation, or hear us preſſe the practiſe and performance of good works, upon mens Conſciences, preſently they think that we are enemies unto the grace of <hi>God,</hi> and do preach nothing but the Law. (For ſo indeed ſome few years ſince, when one heard me tell my hearers, that as long as any one of them did live in ſin, and not practiſe repentance, it was in vain for him to believe, that his ſins
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118801:106"/> were forgiven, and that he ſhould at the comming of Chriſt to judgement riſe again in his own body, to live eternally with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>After he was returned home from the Church, he ſpake aloud in the hearing of divers, and ſaid, here is nothing but preaching of the Law, preaching of Repentance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and ye ſhall be ſaved, repent, and Heaven Gates ſhall be ſet open for you. To the intent therefore, that ſuch poor ſeduced ſouls may be brought to ſee their error, I will handle this matter a little more fully.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all then, It is certain, that the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth perfect obedience of us unto all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, and will not accept of any repentance, if we fall but into any one ſin, or fail in any one duty; but concludeth, and ſhutteth us up under the curſe of <hi>God.</hi> The Doctrine of Repentance therefore (as theſe men think) is not legal,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</note> but meerly Evangelical. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt taught the people repentance, it is ſaid, that he preached not the Law, but the Goſpel. Now it is manifeſt and evident alſo,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15.</note> that all manner of good works, which are the fruits and effects of repentance, are required and commanded in the Goſpel, as well as in the Law.

                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.</note> created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works, which he hath appointed, that we ſhould walk in them. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, that we are created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works; it is certain, that this is the voyce, not of the Law, but of the Goſpel. For the Law neither ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of our new Creation in Chriſt Jeſus, that is, of our Regeneration, neither maketh any mention of Chriſt at all. <hi>Chriſtus enim non eſt revelationis naturalis ſicut eſt lex,</hi>

                  <p>In all theſe, and many other places of the Goſpel, are good works required of us.

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Why the Goſpel, ſeeing it preſcribeth and requireth works, is not to be called a Covenant of works, as well as the Law? Or how it can be ſaid, to be the Covenant of Grace?</head>
                  <p>BUt not unlikely, ſome one or other, will here ſay, what difference is there then in this particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel, if both do urge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of good works? or why is not the Goſpel to be called a Covenant of works, and not of grace, as well as the Law? I will ſhew you the reaſon hereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Law is called the Covenant of works, becauſe works are therein required, as cauſes antecedent to our juſtification and ſalvation; or as that whereby, and for which we are to be juſtified: now, ſo are they not in the Covenant of the Goſpel, as hath been ſufficiently ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, The Law is alſo called the covenant of works, becauſe works are therein commanded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but no power nor ability is miniſtred and given to perform them: but the Goſpel is the miniſtration of the ſpirit.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.</note> For it doth not only command us to repent, and to bring forth the fruits of repentance, which are good works; but ſheweth how we may be inabled to do this, to wit, by faith in Chriſt, who hath merited not only forgiveneſs of ſins; but the ſpirit of ſanctification for all that do believe in him.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14.</note> The Goſpel therefore is a Covenant, not of works, but of grace; not only becauſe it teacheth, that we are juſtified not of works, but of grace; but becauſe by faith in the promiſes thereof, we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grace to repent, and to do all thoſe things, which it requireth of us.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Goſpel is truly ſaid, to be the covenant of grace, becauſe it is ſuch a covenant, as is not only begun, and entred into, but altogether ratified, and conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by grace.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:118801:107"/>
                  <p>For firſt, It was meerly and only of grace and mercy, that <hi>God</hi> after we had broken, and diſſolved the former covenant of works, or of the Law, was pleaſed to enter into a new covenant of ſalvation with us: the form whereof is revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (as I ſaid before) it is meerly of his grace, that God inableth us to perform the conditions of this new covenant, to wit, Faith and Repentance, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would become impoſſible unto us; for we are as unable of our ſelves to repent, and believe in Chriſt, as we are to fulfil the whole Law. Its true, Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are in themſelves eaſier conditions, than the univerſal and moſt perfect obedience which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. But otherwiſe, As, it is as impoſſible for a man, when he is dead to lift up a ſtraw, as an Oxe: ſo, while we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins (as we are all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 3.</note> and of our ſelves) it is as impoſſible for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and obey the Goſpel, as it is for us to fulfill the Law, until we be quickened by the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is of grace that we are kept and upheld by the power of God, from falling away from him, or that he keepeth us firm and faſt in his Covenant; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he ſhould leave us to our ſelves, but a day, or an houre, we ſhould break, and altogether diſſolve the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpel, as we did the legal covenant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is of grace, and not for any merit, or deſert of ours, that we are in part for the preſent,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</note> and ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after perfectly and fully be made partakers of the benefits and bleſſings that are conveyed and paſſed over unto us, in the covenant of the Goſpel, that is to ſay, of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adoption, ſanctification, and glorification, or eternal happineſs in Heaven. Thus the new covenant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is wholly of grace, and therefore deſervedly, it is called the covenant of grace and not of works, as is the Law. Now ſeeing all theſe things are acknowledged, profeſſed, and conſtantly taught by us, what cauſe hath Mr. S. or any other, to ſay, that we turn the Goſpel into a covenant of works, or to alledge againſt us, that ſaying
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118801:108"/> of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.</note> if it be of works, it is no more of grace. Its true indeed, if we did make works any cauſe of our ſalvation, then we ſhould make the Goſpel a covenant of works, as the Law was; but this we do not, but require them as neceſſary conditions to be performed by us, in way of thankfulneſs to <hi>God,</hi> for our ſalvation by Chriſt, and for other neceſſary uſes, and not to merit any thing by them.</p>

                     </label> except perhaps they will ſay, that <hi>John</hi> had before preached the Goſpel to the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and that they had received it. Now they do not deny, but grant and teach, that after that men have received the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then Faith, and Repentance, and new obedience are to be preſſed upon them; but not when Chriſt is firſt offered, and tendered unto them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Johns</hi> preachings may be a ſufficient confutation of ſuch conceipts, and ſurmiſes as this; <label type="milestone">

                     </label> for he began his Miniſtry with the Doctrine of Repentance, as is to be ſeen, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2. And thus when the Apoſtles were ſent by Chriſt, to preach the Goſpel to the Jewes: it is alſo ſaid of them, that they went out, and preached, that men ſhould repent; yea,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.12.</note> contrary to the Opinion and practiſe of our new teachers, we are told, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, when they planted Churches, began and laid the foundation in the Doctrine of Faith and Repentance. And indeed that which is elſe-where written, and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Apoſtles preaching of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, doth ſufficiently evince and teſtifie, that they offered not remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation by Chriſt to all abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any conditions; but exhorted men to repent and believe in Chriſt, that they might obtain pardon of their ſins, and be ſaved by him. Thus when certain, who were pricked in their hearts, by hearing <hi>Peter</hi> preach,<note place="margin">

Theſe things which I have thus alledged, do manifeſt and make it evident, that the Apoſtles did never offer ſalvation unto any, but upon condition of their repentance, and faith in Chriſt. Now that all other Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to do the like, thoſe words of our Saviour, do ſufficiently inform us, when he ſaith, That repentance, and remiſsion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus did Chriſt, and thus did his Apoſtles preach; and thus hath Chriſt ordained, that all other ſhould preach: We may be aſſured therefore, that this is the beſt, or rather the only way of preaching the Goſpel.

                  <p>To ſpeak firſt of the former.</p>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44.</note> that while <hi>Peter</hi> preached the Holy Ghoſt fell on all that heard the word. And while <hi>Lydia</hi> heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, the Lord by his ſpirit opened her

                  <p>But let us ſee how our adverſaries go about to prove, that their Doctrine is more likely to gain ſinners to <hi>God,</hi> and to bring them to repentance, and amendment of life then ours is?</p>

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38.</note> doth obtain grace, and power, and ſtrength to love God, and to obey him.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, That faith of his, upon ſerious and due meditation and conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, of his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal miſery by ſin; and ſecondly, of Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercy towards him in Chriſt, (who ſuffered his moſt bitter paſſion for his redemption; and paſſing by many others, doth offer ſalvation freely unto him) will inflame his heart with the love of God, and excite and ſtir him up to the obedience of his Commandements. But a falſe faith produceth no ſuch gracious effects, but nouriſheth and nuſleth men in carnal ſecurity, as we ſee in many, who fay they believe in Chriſt, and truſt to be ſaved by him, as well as the beſt, and yet live ſtill in their ſins, and never go about to reform themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch is the faith, which Mr. D. and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions do teach; for they will have men to believe, that their ſins are pardoned, and that they are reconciled to God, before they go about to riſe out of them by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which faith of theirs is no true, but a falſe faith; for as I have before proved, repentance and remiſſion of ſins, do alwayes go together.

All therefore that ſuch a faith can do, is but to ſtir up thoſe, who do thus falſly perſwade themſelves that their ſins are pardoned, to love God for his mercy towards them, and to obey him (which it ſeldom or indeed never doth;) but grace it obtaineth none, to crucifie ſin in them, and to ſanctifie them; and therefore though they ſhould ſtrive never ſo much to ſerve God, and to obey him according to all his Commandements, yet it is not poſſible that they ſhould do this, becauſe there is no principle of grace, nor no ſpiritual life in them.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Wherein is ſhewed who do preach Chriſt moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.</head>
                  <p>BY this that hath been ſaid, any one that is not poſſeſt with prejudice, may eaſily ſee and perceive, whether the Proteſtant way of preaching the Goſpel, or the new way taken up here of late in <hi>England,</hi> be like to bring forth better fruits, and to prove more profitable, and more pertinent to the edification of the hearers.</p>
                  <p>To leave this therefore, it remaineth now in the laſt place to be diſcuſſed, whether of theſe two wayes, maketh more for the comfort of mens ſouls and conſciences. Whereunto thus I anſwer, That is ſolid and true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is grounded on Gods infallible word, and not on mens fancies, that are deceiptful. But ſuch is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the old and Orthodox Proteſtant Doctrine affords the hearers thereof, and not the Doctrine of our Noveliſts. For we teach (as the Goſpel doth) that though men have been never ſo great ſinners in times paſt, yet that all thoſe ſins of theirs are forgiven by God and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out when they do repent and believe in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>We exhort therefore, all that do thus repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to be of a good comfort, and not to be terrified with any fear, but to reſt aſſured that they ſhall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be ſaved, through the mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus do we comfort true believers, with the unfalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unfailable promiſes of Gods word, which are the only ſafe and ſure ground of comfort.</p>
                  <p>

                     </label> But I know that our adverſaries in this controverſie, will here be ready to ſay, that they do ſo alſo. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do teach, and tell their hearers, that they were reconciled unto God, and juſtified freely by his grace, before they did believe; and therefore without faith, as we have heard Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſpeak. Yet they ſay, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118801:112"/> they can have no aſſurance hereof, until they believe.</p>
                  <p>Thus they teach men to believe, not that they may be juſtified, but that they may be aſſured of their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſalvation by believing.</p>
                  <p>Now I do willingly acknowledge that true faith, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> when it is wrought in a mans heart, by Gods word and ſpirit, is an undoubted teſtimony of his ſalvation. For as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believeth hath the witneſs,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10.</note> of his adoption, and conſequently of his ſalvation in himſelf. But the faith which theſe men do teach, is nothing elſe but a fancy. For they will have wicked men,<note place="margin">D. his Conf. p. <hi>20. 21.</hi>
                     </note> even when they do continue in their ſins, to believe that theſe ſins of theirs are pardoned; and tell them, that by believing this, they are aſſured of their juſtification before God, and of ſalvation. Now this is not true faith, but deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt damnable preſumption. For faith is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promi es of God, and to rely upon them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.41, 42.</note> as on its foundation.</p>
                  <p>Now I would know, whether God have any where made any promiſe of forgiveneſs to men, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their ſins? ſurely no; but on the contrary, he threatneth them by his Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That he will wound the hairy ſcalpe of ſuch as go on forward in their wickedneſs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21.</note> And our Saviour himſelf told his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <hi>That except they did repent, they ſhould all periſh.</hi> It is not poſſible therefore, for any to believe, (truly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 13.3.</note> I mean) that their ſins are pardoned until they do repent. Or if, even then while they continue in ſin, they will needs perſwade themſelves, as many do, that their ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and forgiven through Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits, this is nothing elſe but preſumption. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that preach thus, inſtead of comforting their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers (as they perſwade them, and make them to believe) do nothing elſe, but delude and deceive them. For true juſtifying faith, is not for a ſinner, whilſt he continueth in his ſins, to believe that they are pardoned, which is falſe; but to rely upon Chriſt, for the pardon of them, according to the promiſes of his Goſpel, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118801:113"/> to his own fancy, and fond imagination, as Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and carnal Goſpellers do. That this is that faith, whereby we obtain pardon of our ſins, and are juſtified before Gods tribunal, St. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh manifeſt and plain, when he ſaith, <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi>

                     <hi>being juſtified freely by his grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation by faith in his blood.</hi> It is not then our believing that our ſins are pardoned, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; but it is our faith in Chriſts blood, that is, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the merits of his death and paſsion, whereby we obtain the pardon of them: even as many did in like manner, by faith in Chriſt obtain the health of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from our Saviour, when they were miraculouſly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him.<note place="margin">

                  <p>For when our Saviour required faith of them, ſaying,<note place="margin">

No, for that was falſe: but that Chriſt was of that power, that he could, and ſo gracious and good, that he would heal them, and hereupon to rely, and put their truſt and confidence in him, that he would cure them. This was their faith, whereby they obtained the health of their bodies from Chriſt, as is yet further to be ſeen in the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Woman.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23</note> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, He telleth us, <hi>That without faith;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to pleaſe God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hereunto I anſwer, That although Repentance goeth before that act of faith, whereby a man believeth that his ſins are pardoned: yet it doth not follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that it goeth before all faith in general, no nor yet before juſtifying and ſaving faith. For if I ſhall ſpeak Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically and properly, there are (as I conceive) no leſſe then foure ſeveral acts of faith; but I do make choyce rather to ſpeak popularly, and therefore I will contract two of them into one.</p>
                  <p>The firſt act of faith, is for a man to believe, that the whole word of God is true, or that I may ſpeak more particularly to the matter in hand, it is for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Jeſus Chriſt, being ſent of his Father, hath
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118801:114"/> perfectly wrought and accompliſhed our ſalvation, and that he doth offer this ſalvation unto all thoſe, who do repent and believe in him. This act of faith doth not only go before repentance, but before all other acts of faith alſo. For if a man do not believe, both that Chriſt hath abſolutely, and perfectly accompliſhed our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation, and that he doth alſo offer the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath purchaſed unto all that do repent, and believe in him, he will have no incouragement, neither will it be poſſible for him, either to repent, or believe, &amp; to reſt and rely on Chriſt for ſalvation. This is that faith which is commonly called <hi>fides dogmatica, vel hiſtorica,</hi> doctrinal, or hiſtorical faith, becauſe it goeth not beyond the faith of the Doctrine, or of the Hiſtory of the Bible. Now this, though it be abſolutely neceſſary unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it is not ſaving faith becauſe it juſtifieth no man, nor giveth to any man any intereſt, or right unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond act of faith is, That a man do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, though his ſins be never ſo many, or never ſo great; but believe, or perſwade himſelf, that God of his mercy through Chriſt will pardon them, and ſo caſt himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt; or that he do truſt upon Chriſt for ſalvation, according to the promiſes of the Goſpel. This is ſaving faith; or it is that act of faith, whereby we are juſtified and ſaved, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us to underſtand in thoſe words of his (which I have already alledged) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24, 25. <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through faith in his blood.</hi> Behold, it is faith in Chriſts blood, that is in his death and paſsion whereby God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth propitious, that is, gracious and merciful unto us; and conſequently whereby we are juſtified, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now this act of faith, is in nature before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though in time it go with it.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:118801:114"/>
                  <p>I will make this plain by a familiar compariſon. <hi>Sol eſt natura prior lumine ex illo orto.</hi> The Sun is in nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the light that ſpringeth, and proceedeth from it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in nature the cauſe is alwayes before the effect: but the Sun and its light are <hi>ſimul tempore,</hi> together in time. For as ſoon as the Sun was created, and placed by God in the Firmament, at the very ſame inſtant, did it illighten the World.</p>
                  <p>And even ſo in like manner faith in Chriſt, is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before repentance; but they go together in time. For ſeeing there is no promiſe of pardon made to any one in the Goſpel, while he continueth in ſin, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neceſſarily therefore that true juſtifying faith cannot be ſeparated from repentance, no more then ſaving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance can be without ſuch a true faith. And this (as I take it) is the cauſe, why remiſsion of ſins and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are in ſome places of holy Scripture, attributed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and in ſome other to ſaith, to wit, becauſe faith and repentance are as it were twiſted and infolded the one in the other. For neither can a man repent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, nor can he believe in Chriſt, for the pardon of his ſins, unleſs his faith did ſtir up repentance in him, and a ſetled purpoſe to forſake all ſin. For as long as a man liveth in ſin, he hath no promiſe from God to ground his faith upon.</p>
                  <p>The true Chriſtian therefore in believing repenteth, and in repenting believeth: theſe are two inſeparable Companions, and as it were twins, that are bread and born together. Although then that act of faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we do believe in Chriſt, is in nature before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the cauſe is before the effect: yet there is no priority, nor poſteriority of time between them;<note place="margin">Faith is the firſt wheel in the Clock, that moveth all the reſt. Mr. Panb. Vind. Grat.</note> for a man cannot believe in Chriſt for ſalvation, according to the promiſes of the Goſpel, unleſs this faith of his do excite and ſtir him up to the practiſe of repentance.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt act of faith, is that whereby a man believeth that his ſins are blotted out and forgiven, and that he is in the ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:118801:115"/>
                  <p>The former is called a direct act, becauſe it maketh a man to look directly upon Chriſt, and to caſt himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>This latter is called a reflexed act, becauſe a Chriſtian reflecting and looking back upon himſelf and his own ſoul, ſeeth faith and repentance wrought in him; and hereupon concludeth that his ſins are pardoned, and that he now is the Child of God, and an Heire of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: This he believeth, becauſe he ſeeth the conditions accompliſhed in him, to which God hath promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins and ſalvation, that is to ſay, faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>Thus whereas the former act of faith, whereby a man doth truly believe in Chriſt, maketh him partaker of the remiſſion of ſins, and giveth him right, and a true title to the Kingdom of Heaven: this latter aſſureth him of this, and breedeth and begetteth great peace, quietneſs, and comfort in his heart and conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Now this laſt act of faith, whereby a man thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that his ſins are pardoned, and is aſſured of his ſalvation, doth not go before, but followeth after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For until a man ſeeth and perceiveth that he hath forſaken ſin, and that he doth repent, he cannot confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe that his ſins are pardoned, nor can he have any firm aſſurance of ſalvation, becauſe he hath no word of promiſe from God, whereon to ground that faith and aſſurance of his.</p>

                     </label> Another ſtumbling-block, which our Novelliſts have caſt in the way of many good Chriſtians, is this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15</note> that Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners: behold ſay theſe men, he came to ſave ſinners, not repentant ſinners; and hereupon they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and conclude, that a man before he repenteth, even at that very time, when he liveth in ſin, ought to believe that his ſins are pardoned, and that he is in the ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:118801:115"/>
                  <p>But I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> That they do deceive both themſelves and others, <hi>fallacia conſequentis,</hi> with a fallacious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For when, or how doth Chriſt ſave ſinners? ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12.</note> not while they do continue in ſin without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for he himſelf telleth us, that he calleth them to repentance, and ſo ſaveth them. But for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, and yet to be ſaved, are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> things that will not conſiſt nor ſtand together, for this implyeth a manifeſt contradiction. Thus then it is, Chriſt ſaveth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by freeing and delivering them, both from the gilt of their ſins, and from the tyranny and dominion of ſin, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his ſpirit. For ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> having rehearſed and reckoned up many foul, and filthy, and fearful ſins, wherewith the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had ſpotted and polluted themſelves in times paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their converſion to the faith of Chriſt, preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>but ye are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the blood of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the greateſt folly and madneſs in the World therefore, for a man to believe that his ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that he is in the ſtate of ſalvation, as long as he continueth and remaineth an impenitent, and unreform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner: for the Angel of the Lord that was ſent unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the eſpouſed Husband of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> telleth us how we are ſaved by Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26.2.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>He shall ſave his people in their ſins,</hi> that is while they live and lie in them; <hi>But he shall ſave them from their ſins,</hi> that is, by freeing and delivering them from them. Whereof St. <hi>Peter</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſureth us, in that ſaying of his to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſſe you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That I may make this matter yet more plain, and remove all ambiguity: this I add further, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave ſinners,</hi> he ſpeaketh not <hi>de partiali, ſed totali ſalute,</hi> not of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118801:116"/> ſalvation in part, but of that whole ſalvation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, and worketh in us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon us, that is to ſay, not of the pardon of our ſins only, but as well alſo of our ſanctification, and of all other things that do any way or other concur to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of our ſalvation. For Chriſt doth not ſave us in part, but moſt perfectly. He hath purchaſed for us, not only our juſtification, but our adoption, ſanctification, redemption from Hell, and glorification in Heaven. And hereupon it is,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is made unto us of God wiſdom, justice, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> We muſt therefore rely upon Chriſt by faith for all theſe, and not ſeparate any one of them from the reſt, as carnal Proteſtants do, who believe in Chriſt for the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and for their ſalvation in Heaven; but not for grace, whereby to mortifie their ſinful luſts, and to live holily.</p>
                  <p>Now wha, Can this faith of theirs ſave them? no ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for Chriſts merits muſt not be ſeparated and divided, no more then his perſon. Chriſt in his Goſpel offereth both himſelf and all his merits unto us. He therefore that receiveth him as man, but not as God, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth him as his Prieſt to reconcile him unto God, and to ſave him from Hell; but not as his King to command him, and to reign over him, that receiveth him for his juſtification, but not for his ſanctification, ſetteth up a falſe Chriſt unto himſelf, and ſhall receive no ſalvation from him at all.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. V.</hi> A twofold Corollary, or concluſion deduced and drawn from the former anſwers.</head>
                  <p>BY this that I have ſaid, in anſwer to the two former objections, it may appear, that faith is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either more ſtrictly, as it relateth to our juſtification;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118801:116"/> or more largely, as it hath reference to our whole ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To believe in Chriſt, to our juſtification, is (as I have ſaid before) for us to rely upon him, for the pardon of our ſins, not according to our own fancies and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, but according to the gracious promiſes of his Goſpel. For ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Goſpel <hi>verbum fidei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8.</note> the word of faith, that is, the word of faith which we preach; as if he ſhould have ſaid, That Goſpel, which we the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and other his faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do preach, is the word of faith. Now wherefore is it that <hi>Paul</hi> doth call the Goſpel the word of faith?</p>
                  <p>Is it not firſt, Becauſe faith is bred and begotten in our hearts, by the hearing of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, Becauſe it is built and grounded on the Goſpel as on its foundation? For our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo telleth us, That the faith which he requireth of us, is the faith of the Goſpel, or it is for us to believe the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now I have proved already,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.42</note> that Chriſt in his Goſpel doth no where offer pardon to ſuch as continue in ſin, but only to thoſe that repent, and turn unto him from their evil wayes. And hereupon St. <hi>Peter</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed the Jews of great and groſſe impiety againſt God, and his Sonne Chriſt Jeſus, afterwards exhorteth them, and ſaith, <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, &amp;c.</hi> And at the end of that Chapter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19.</note> he telleth the Jewes, (as we have already heard) that God ſent his Sonne to ſave them (not by ſuffering them to continue in their ſins; but) by turning every one of them from their iniquities.</p>
                  <p>This I have the more largely inſiſted on, that none may, neither fancy, that their ſins are pardoned, while they do live in them without repentance; nor yet rely upon Chriſt, for the pardon of them, unleſs they do ſtir up themſelves to the practiſe of repentance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Faith be conſidered more largely, as it hath reference to our whole ſalvation, ſo (as I have ſaid
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118801:117"/> before) we are to rely upon Chriſt, not for the pardon of our ſins, and for our redemption and deliverance from Hell only;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38.</note> but as well alſo for our ſanctification, and for all things, which do accompliſh &amp; conſummate our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for all theſe are we to rely upon Chriſt, in the uſe of all thoſe means which he hath preſcribed us, ſuch as are the reading, hearing, meditating of Gods word, laying of it up in our hearts, &amp; the applying of it to our ſouls, with prayer, godly conference, ſtriving againſt ſin, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to do the things which <hi>God</hi> commandeth, and the like. For <hi>God</hi> will not have us to be idle, but to uſe ſuch means, as he hath appointed for the furtherance of our ſalvation, and to depend upon him for his bleſſing on them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.18.</note> which he will not deny, but in due time vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe us: for as the holy Prophet ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearing of what hath been ſaid, I will briefly anſwer an Objection or two, that I have lately met with.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There are thoſe that reaſon thus, The faith which Chriſt requireth in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that we may be ſaved by him, muſt needs include more in it then truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his blood; for ſuch faith or confidence is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſenſitive part, or faculty of the Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſure note of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto I anſwer, That affections are not only in the ſenſitive appetite, but alſo in the will; for wherefore elſe is it, that the will is ſaid to be <hi>appetitus rationalis, ſi nil appetat?</hi> And is not love an affection of the ſoul? yet every one is commanded to love the Lord his <hi>God</hi> with all his heart, with all his ſoul, with all his ſtrength, and with all his mind, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.27. that is, with the ſuperior, as well as the inferior faculties of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The other Objection which I have met with is this. Chriſt juſtifieth us as our King, abſolving and acquitting us from the ſentence of condemnation, which we by our ſins had deſerved, and not only as our Prieſt, by his blood,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118801:117"/> which he ſhed for us, when he offered up himſelf as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto his Father.</p>
                  <p>Unto this I anſwer, That Chriſt juſtifieth us <hi>per modum meriti,</hi> by way of merit, as our great high Prieſt, offering up himſelf as a propitiatory ſacrifice unto his Father for us. But he juſtifieth us as our King, and our ſupreme judge, by abſolving us from our ſins, and pronouncing us righteous for the merit of his blood and obedience, whereby he became obedient unto his Father unto death, even the death of the Croſſe, and ſo fulfilled the Law for us. Whereas then St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (and we alſo with him) that we are juſtified freely, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood: the meaning hereof is, that we do rely on Chriſts death and paſſion, as the only meanes whereby Gods wrath is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and our ſalvation purchaſed. But all this nothing hindereth, but we may, and do willingly grant and hold, as an undoubted truth, that we muſt receive Chriſt, not only as our Prieſt, to be reconciled unto God by him; but as well alſo as our Prophet, to be taught the will of God by him, and as our King to raign over us, if we would be ſaved by him, and live for ever.</p>

And laſtly, It cannot but be alſo a great comfort unto us, that whereas the Law condemneth us, for every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience of ours; yet the Lord of his rich mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, is pleaſed to accept of our ſervice, when we do not lie ſtill in our ſins, after we are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118801:118"/> fallen; but do riſe again by repentance, and endeavour to obey him, according to all his Commandements. If any man were bound upon a great penalty, to go to any place or other without ſtumbling, or falling, if he do but once trip and ſtumble in his journey, he incurs that penalty: and even ſo in like manner, becauſe the Law requireth univerſal obedience of us, and curſeth us, if we break but any one Commandement thereof: therefore if we ſhould commit but one ſin in all our life, there were no hope of ſalvation by the Law; but a fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of judgement and wrath everlaſting. But now ſeeing Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law; and, although he commandeth us to walk before him in all the wayes of his Commandements, is yet pleaſed to pardon our falls, if we do not lye ſtill, and welter and wallow in the puddle of our ſins, as many do; but riſe again by repentance. O what a comfort may this be unto us? For even as a little Child that is weak, and begins to go, may truly be ſaid to walk to ſuch or ſuch a place, although he taketh many a fall, if he do not lie ſtill, but riſe again preſently, and never ceaſe going, until he come thither: ſo although, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2.</note> we do in many things offend all, that is, take many falls while we are in our journey towards Heaven: yet if we do not lie ſtill in any ſin, but riſe up again ſpeedily by repentance, and proceed in our obedience to Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we may truly be ſaid to walk in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſhall in the end come to Heaven, through the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <p>We read in the fifth of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, that a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of impotent people, of blind, halt, and withered, lay by the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> waiting for the moving of the waters.

A worthy Expoſition! for will it not hence follow, that a man may have his ſins pardoned, and forgiven by God, though he never forgive thoſe that offend him: but this will not be ſo evident to his Conſcience? Yet for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this his Expoſition, he alledgeth thoſe words of our Saviour,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But I anſwer, Forgiveneſs is here taken really, and properly, and her great and abundant love to Chriſt, was the evidence, and manifeſtation thereof. As if I ſhould ſay, The Sun is riſen; for it ſhineth upon the wall. In this ſpeech the meaning is, that the Sun is really riſen, though perhaps that might not be the very firſt moment of the riſing thereof, when this was ſpoken; and the Suns ſhining upon the wall is made a ſign, or an evidence and manifeſtation thereof. And even ſo in like manner, when our Saviour ſaith, Her ſins which are many are forgiven her, his meaning was, that they were really forgiven, though not at that inſtant onely, but from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her converſion. And he maketh this manifeſt, by his next words, from her abundant love, which ſhe ſo many wayes ſhewed and expreſſed towards him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, For ſhe loved much.</p>
                  <p>I know Mr. D. will not here ſay with the Papiſts, that her love to Chriſt, was the cauſe that he pardoned and forgave her her ſins; but that he drew an Argument from thence to prove, and to evidence that her ſins were forgiven. And ſo this conjunction cauſal <hi>(for) eſt cauſa conſequentiae, non conſequentis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Many good ſouls have acknowledged, that when all other grounds of comfort have failed them, or at the leaſt, when in time of temptation, they have not been able to apprehend any comfort from any thing elſe: yet theſe words of the Apoſtle have upheld them from deſpairing of their Eſtate, becauſe their Conſciences did teſtifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that they did unfainedly love, and ardently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all that are godly.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118801:122"/> that a man may know by his love to the Brethren, that he himſelf particularly is in the ſtate of grace; but that the faithful in general, by means of the love which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and ſhewed one to another, were well perſwaded one of another, and believed by the judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that they were all the Children of God. But this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his, croſſeth the main ſcope and drift, or the purpoſe and intention of the Apoſtle, in writing this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, which was to comfort the faithful, by ſhewing them what ſignes and tokens, and particular evidences they had of the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt; for ſo he ſaith, Chap. 5.13. Theſe things have I written unto you (whereof their love to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren was one) that believe on the name of the Sonne of God, that ye may know, that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God, that is, perſeverantly unto the end.</p>
                  <p>What will Mr. D. except againſt this? Will he ſay, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> and the Papiſts do, that the Apoſtles meaning is not, that every, or any ordinary faithful man knoweth certainly, that he is tranſlated from death to life, and therefore in the ſtate of ſalvation? but that he ſpeaketh generally in the perſon of all the faithful, and is thus to be underſtood? We Chriſtians know by an aſſured faith, that all good faithful people (of which number we ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally truſt that we are) are tranſlated from death to life. But ſurely this Expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his, <hi>eſt nimis jejuna,</hi> is too hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and leane. For what comfort will it be to any one, to know certainly, that all good Chriſtians, and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are tranſlated from death to life, as long as he knoweth not, whether he himſelf be of that number, but doubteth hereof?</p>
                  <p>Again, Shall we think, or can we perſwade our ſelves, that St. <hi>John</hi> wrote ſo large an Epiſtle, and uſed ſo many Arguments, only to make known unto the faithful, that all good Chriſtians, or that all good faithful people have their ſins pardoned, and are in the ſtate of ſalvation, which they never doubted of.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:118801:122"/>
                  <p>Its certain, That St. <hi>John</hi> in writing this Epiſtle, had a farther intent, and that is to make it evident unto us, by many infallible ſignes and tokens, how we may know, that we are the Children of God, and that we are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life, which is a matter of greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and rejoycing to a Chriſtian heart, that can be.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>D.</hi> indeed (for I would not willingly do him any wrong) acknowledgeth that true charity is an aſſured ſigne or mark of grace received; but for all that,<note place="margin">Cor a ſ pag.</note> he holdeth that a Chriſtian cannot certainly know, that he hath charity, whereby he may be aſſured, that he is the Child of God. But herein he joyneth with the Papiſts. For they ſay, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> doth, <hi>quantum de dilectione fraternâ certi ſumus, tantum &amp; de iſto,</hi> look how much we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of our love to the Brethren; ſo much are we aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that alſo: he meaneth, that we are tranſlated from death to life, whereof he ſpake before. Now he hath told us, that this cannot certainly be known of us, and ſo his meaning is, as alſo Mr. D. that we cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, but conjecturally only know, that we love the Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Thus both Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and they, would make St. <hi>John</hi> a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſory diſputant, as if he would prove <hi>ignotum per ignotius,</hi> that which is unknown to us, by another thing, which is as much, or more unknown; for how can we know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren? if we have no more certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this, then of the former. Our conjectural hope that we love the Brethren, will only breed, and beget in us an Opinion that we are tranſlated from death to life, but no knowledge thereof at all. But on the contrary St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith not, We hope, we conjecture, or we think; but we know that we have paſſed from death to life. And he proveth it as <hi>effectu, tanquam ſigno hujus infallibili,</hi> by an effect of this tranſlation, as an infallible ſign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; becauſe (ſaith he) we love the Brethren.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:118801:123"/>
                  <p>Thus he maketh our love of the Brethren, an evidence that we are in the ſtate of ſalvation. And hereupon St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writing on theſe words ſaith, <hi>redeat unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſ<expan>

                        </expan> ad cor ſuum: Si ibi invenerit charitatem fraternam, ſecurus ſit, quia tranſiit à morte ad vitam.</hi> Let every one return unto his own heart: if he doth there finde bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly charity, let him be ſecure, becauſe he hath paſſed from death to life.</p>
                  <p>Surely St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would never have ſpoken thus, if he had thought, that a Chriſtian can have no certain knowledge of his love to the Brethren. For it is not an uncertain hope, or an opinion grounded on conjectures, that can breed and beget any ſecurity in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſtian Reader, I have given thee a taſt of Mr. D. his faculty, in expounding of the Scriptures after his fancy. More of his detorted Expoſitions, I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee with, becauſe I neither remember any more, nor have his Book by me, it being reſtored to the owner, by him that lent it me long ſince. And indeed, I ſhould both trouble my ſelf, and the Reader, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing any more of them; and this Treatiſe would ſwell, and grow into too great a bulk, whereby the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſort of Chriſtians might be deterred, and diſcouraged from reading of it; for whoſe ſake principally, I have penned and publiſhed it, that they may be ſetled and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the truth, which hath been formerly taught them, and not be carried away with the deceiptfulneſs of novellous errors.</p>
